486772,malaria,IND,8/8/2010 21:28,NA,"The mosquito sting has the country's commercial capital thronging hospitals this monsoon season, with the number of deaths due to malaria recording a high and hospitals spilling over with patients. The civic body — responsible for tackling monsoon-related diseases — has been forced to rope in private practitioners and private laboratories. Alarmed with the figures being reported out of Mumbai, the Centre had sent a team of health experts who have submitted a detailed report. As per data recorded with the Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, there has been a 55 per cent increase in the number of positive cases and 15 per cent increase in the falcifarum variety in Mumbai in comparison to the cases reported between April 2009 and June 2010. There have been 31 deaths due to malaria so far this year. In 2009, the BMC had reported a 10 per cent rise in cases with the civic body identifying 134 new high risk areas in the city along the construction sites of Metro rail. Civic officials and health experts in Mumbai have blamed the increased construction activity for the spurt in malaria cases. Not only are these construction sites ideal breeding ground for the female anopheles mosquito, labourers from malaria endemic states like Chhattisgarh, who work at these sites, are also being blamed for spreading the disease. The 2,500-odd construction sites here give abundant scope for fresh water collection after rains through water stored in tanks, layer of water on the surface of cement used for 'curing' the concrete and puddles of water in and around the place of construction. Three lakh migrant workers at these construction sites are also being blamed for the spread of malaria. The logic being that they carry the plasmodium parasite responsible for malaria. As per the BMC, 58 per cent of Mumbai's 19,500 malaria cases recorded since June 1 are concentrated in seven civic wards. About 33 per cent of the cases this monsoon were recorded in Sewri, Mahalaxmi, Byculla, Chembur and Ghatkopar, while 25 per cent of the cases were recorded in Reay Road, Mahim Causeway, Dharavi, airport, Santacruz and Vikhroli. These areas have a high number of construction sites that have stagnant water, the rising number of slum-dwellers and presence of dilapidated mills. About 83 per cent of those who tested positive for malaria comprise construction workers and slum-dwellers. 'The Central team is of the view that major construction activity and monsoons are the reasons for high incidences of malaria,' said Dr R K Srivastava, Director General of health services (DGHS). The Central team was also adverse to the idea of the builders being entrusted with the work of vector control. 'In other states vector control is done by the government and not by the builders. This is one of the reasons for the high level of mosquito breeding seen in Mumbai,' added another official. Dr A C Dhariwal, Director of the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme, said the Central team had found that several construction sites and abandoned buildings (textile mills) were breeding grounds for mosquitoes. 'Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata have reported malaria cases, but the figure is the highest in Mumbai. The number of deaths due to malaria is also the highest in Mumbai. The local civic body has identified certain wards where maximum cases are being reported,' said Dr Dhariwal. Adding to the government's woes, even the milder variety of plasmodium vivax has reported complications in some instances prompting civic body and doctors to take a closer look at the treatment of the disease. 'According to the WHO guidelines, chloroquine should still be the first drug for uncomplicated malaria. If a patient reports four-five days of fever, it is advisable to avoid risks and start multi-drug treatment,' said Dr Sanjay Oak, the BMC's Director For Medical Education and Research. Civic officials have drawn support from private hospitals to tackle the 'spurt' in malaria cases as its own hospitals are overflowing with patients. The health concern has been converted into a political controversy with the Shiv Sena and MNS blaming 'migrants' for the spread of malaria. NCP's Mumbai president Narendra Verma, on the other hand, has said it's the Shiv Sena-run BMC that should be blamed.",NA,NA,1,,,,,,,
565104,cholera,HTI,10/28/2010 14:51,NA,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (AFP) - – Haiti's cholera toll rose Thursday above 300, as doctors sought desperately to contain the epidemic as victims overwhelmed the quake-hit nation's crumbling hospitals, spilling into its maternity wards. One week after cholera was confirmed in Haiti for the first time in decades, the death rate is slowing but almost 5,000 people have now been infected and officials warn it could be years before it is eradicated. Clinics were beyond capacity with cholera patients on the floor of one radiology department and another five-bed maternity center, not well equipped to treat the virulent diarrheal disease, housing 300 patients. The source of the outbreak is still unclear, although MINUSTAH, the UN peacekeeping force is probing claims its septic tanks leaked into the Artibonite river and contaminated it with fecal bacteria. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned the outbreak was far from over and Haiti should prepare for the disease to hit its capital Port-au-Prince, which is teeming with tent cities after January's catastrophic earthquake. 'We cannot say it is contained,' WHO's cholera chief, Claire-Lise Chaignat, told journalists in Geneva. 'I think we haven't reached the peak,' she said, recommending that Haitian authorities prepare for the 'worst case scenario' -- cholera in the capital. The acute intestinal infection is caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with the Vibrio cholerae bacteria. The source of the infection is believed to have been the Artibonite river, a major artery that runs through Haiti to the coast near Saint Marc -- the outbreak's epicenter some 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of Port-au-Prince. Scene: Haitians drinking water from infected river Although easily treated, cholera has a short incubation period -- sometimes just a few hours -- and causes acute watery diarrhea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death. Some 1.3 million people displaced by the 7.0 earthquake on January 12 are still crammed into thousands of makeshift camps. Aid agencies fear cholera could spread like wildfire in such conditions. Fear of the disease is turning to anger, as Haitians begin to blame foreign aid workers and peacekeepers for the Caribbean nation's first ever outbreak of cholera. The installation of a vital treatment center in Saint-Marc had to be halted on Wednesday after some 300 residents confronted doctors and aid workers. Fueled by fear the facility would spread cholera to two nearby schools, residents hurled stones at medical workers of the international medical agency Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The specialized treatment center was being set up outside the overwhelmed Saint Nicolas hospital here, where some 800 patients are already being treated with hundreds of new cases arriving each day, officials said. Argentine troops with MINUSTAH moved in, stopped the protest, and then oversaw the dismantling of the facility. 'It was a big misunderstanding,' Haitian doctor Yfto Maquette told AFP in the hospital's chaotic courtyard overflowing with patients who were supposed to have been moved to the new facility. 'The fact that we don't have the center is stopping us from effectively treating people,' said an MSF official who declined to be named. 'We need to get the message out that cholera is a disease that we are very experienced in treating,' he said. Maquette pointed out there was still need for basic response tools for the crisis, saying the medical team 'only has one ambulance to bring people into the hospital.' Meanwhile, the group's field coordinator in Saint-Marc was optimistic the epidemic was being controlled. 'The fact that we are seeing fewer severe cases is positive,' said Federica Nogarotto, the MSF field coordinator in Saint-Marc. 'It suggests that people are taking precautions and that there is a greater understanding in the community of the need to maintain strict hygiene and to seek medical assistance at the first sign of symptoms.' Among the young patients at Saint Nicholas was four-year-old Jules Djelickson, who lay motionless on a cot, staring vacantly into the distance, as his mother Pacius Celette waved a grubby rag to keep flies off his face. Asked about the MSF site being shut down, she said: 'The community is scared, but they don't have a choice, we need it.'",NA,NA,1,,,,,,,

Amid scares that the influenza A (H1N1), swine flu, cases were accumulating throughout the nation and the world, patients rushed to emergency rooms with the slightest sign of symptoms. As a result, a significant challenge for hospitals over the last week was separating the worried well from the truly sick. In California, where there have been 26 confirmed cases of H1N1, the Hospital Association of Southern California reported 12% more patients in Los Angeles hospitals, according to the L.A. Times . Many hospitals had to quickly isolate those who were visibly ill, whereas those complaining of symptoms were given masks and separated from other ER patients. The worried well were evaluated and sent home. San Joaquin Community Hospital in Bakersfield, CA, reported a daily record of 188 patients in the ER, none of whom even had symptoms that required testing. In New York City, which tallied 49 confirmed cases, children s hospitals were particularly swamped, according to the New York Times . In many cases patients were referred to the hospital by their doctor even though they did not demonstrate symptoms like fever and nausea associated with swine flu. At Children s Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the ER saw 392 patients on Wednesday and 369 on Thursday, doubling their average amount, according to the New York Times .

518593,dengue,IND,9/6/2010 20:58,NA,"Preperations for the New Delhi Commonwealth Games have been hampered by fears of an outbreak of dengue fever. (AFP: Manan Vatsyayana) There are fears an outbreak of dengue fever in New Delhi is getting worse with just a month to go until the Commonwealth Games. Exacerbated by waterlogged construction sites and striking fumigators, dozens of new cases of the mosquito-borne disease have been reported in the last few days. Further bad news predicts monsoon rains are likely to linger, possibly into October, when the Games begin. Unpleasant blasts of fogging machines are being used to keep mosquitoes at bay, but the mass fumigation has not been enough. The medical superintendent of one of Delhi's largest public hospitals, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr DK Sharma, says dengue cases have been on the rise since July. 'The number of dengue patients coming to the Institute this year, as a matter of fact in the whole of Delhi, is much more than last year,' he said. He says more than 1,300 cases of dengue fever have now been reported, and three people have died. The hospital is overloaded with patients, with those who have been turned away camping on the ground outside. 'Once there is a surge in the number of dengue patients and we have to admit some of these, naturally some other patients who would normally have got admitted have to be deferred,' Dr Sharma said. Dr Sharma says the dengue season does not peak until September or October, and this is likely to only be the start of the problem. 'If we are able to control the water stagnation, if we are able to control the larval breeding, and kill adult mosquitoes, well I'm very hopeful on that score,' he said. 'Our civic agencies are working very hard to control this menace.' However, as billboards warn the public how to prevent mosquitoes breeding, directly across the road from the hospital, bulldozers sit beside pools of stagnant water. India Meteorological Department forecaster Brahma Prakash Yadav says there has already been double the usual August rains, but he cannot predict when the monsoon will pass. 'This is a meteorological factor. Nobody can help it,' he said. Or almost nobody. Delhi's chief minister Sheila Dikshit says the weather and the Games preparations are now in the hands of the rain god.",NA,NA,1,,,,,,,
482304,influenza,AUS,8/2/2010 19:58,0,"Swine flu has become the dominant flu virus in New Zealand and some emergency departments are struggling to cope. Hospital admissions for winter illnesses hit a high for the year last week, although numbers were well down compared to last year's outbreak. Almost 1900 people visited hospitals in the week with flu-like symptoms. One emergency department estimates up to two-thirds of patients have been given Tamiflu or its generic equivalent, oseltamivir. Many Auckland schools reported about one child per class had been sick each day, and the city's hospitals said they were running near capacity. In Northland, Whangarei emergency department clinical leader Scott Cameron said his team was overloaded: 'It's very uncomfortable for us in terms of staffing and space.' Last year, many people with the flu were kept away from hospitals. But this year, people with flu-like symptoms have flooded emergency departments - and staff numbers are down with many having caught the flu themselves. Swine flu - or, more accurately, Influenza A H1N1 09 - became a pandemic last year. Waikato Hospital clinical microbiologist Chris Mansell said swine flu was currently the only influenza strain circulating New Zealand. Dr Mansell's laboratory tests for patients in Waikato and the Bay of Plenty have found up to one in 10 patients with a winter illness had influenza, with only swine flu detected. The Ministry of Health said tests showed swine flu was the predominant strain this year. Swine flu is the year's biggest threat among winter illnesses, but it is already well established and therefore less likely to explode. The Ministry of Health estimates more than a million New Zealanders - almost a third of the country - have been exposed to swine flu and have become immune to the strain, including those who received a vaccine. People visiting hospitals with the flu were likely just a hundredth of the total with swine flu, Dr Mansell said. People who are overweight or pregnant, smoke or have lung conditions could face complications. Pregnant women with flu-like symptoms had a high chance of contracting a severe disease and were strongly urged to get immediate advice from their doctor, Dr Jarman said. Dr Mansell said his Waikato laboratory was running at about 80 per cent capacity, and Ministry of Health figures show consultations are down as much as six-fold from last year. But influenza usually spikes with a sudden upsurge spanning about two weeks, and this could still be coming. Fifty-nine people were admitted to hospital with swine flu last week, bringing the total to 159. Two people have died from the virus this year. Non-influenza viruses circulating New Zealand include rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, which is highly contagious and demands isolation at hospitals. ",NA,en,1,,,,,,,
366058,influenza,AUS,1/15/2010 9:49,0,"HEALTH experts are warning that Australians can expect a second wave of swine flu, possibly as early as the beginning of the school year just a fortnight away. With a new report finding Australia's public health response failed to prevent the H1N1 pandemic last year -- and that mass casualties and a collapse of the health system would have resulted had it not been a benign strain -- the Australian Medical Association has said it is likely swine flu will strike again. AMA vice-president Steven Hambleton, a member of the national pandemic planning committee, said yesterday it would be difficult to prevent a 'second wave' as the virus was again sweeping the northern hemisphere. It has also overtaken all other strains of the virus as the dominant variety of influenza. Overseas H1N1 comprises 99 per cent of all flu strains, while in Australia that figure is about 80 per cent. 'We're expecting to reimport the virus and to see people getting sick again,' Dr Hambleton said. 'There have been second waves in most countries that had early exposure last year, and with so many people travelling to places like Northern America over Christmas we can expect a second wave too.' Jeremy McAnulty, an epidemiologist with NSW Health, said the virus could strike earlier than the regular winter flu season this year as it had also emerged out of season overseas. And he warned there was an added risk of it spreading when children returned to school. 'Studies around the world show you get an increase in infections at back-to-school time,' Dr McAnulty said. 'Families need to heed the message and get vaccinated.' The doctors' comments came as a paper published in the medical journal Respirology described Australia's public health response to swine flu as a failure and noted that the H1N1 pandemic gained 'rapid and widespread entry' into Australia. 'That Australia did not see mass casualties and a complete collapse of the country's health system is attributable to the relatively benign course of the pandemic H1N1 2009 infection, not due to any public health success,' co-author Grant Waterer said. Factors contributing to the failure included the asymptomatic properties of the virus, long screening delays, inadequately trained GPs and communication breakdowns. However Professor Waterer added that the inability to contain swine flu should not be blamed on government, and neither were resources misspent. Dr Hambleton said a review of the public health response was needed to ensure such a widespread outbreak did not occur again. 'There has to be a review. If the pandemic lasted another two weeks, our intensive care capacity in this country would have been overwhelmed,' he said. 'Imagine if it was severe? In Victoria we'd have had GPs dropping off the perch left, right and centre because they were left without protective equipment early on. And remember the (Pacific Dawn) boat cruise? We let people go home . . . and they started spreading it too.'",NA,en,1,,,,,,,
3127,dengue,IND,10/3/2006 12:07,NA,"Dengue fever outbreak overwhelms Delhi hospitals - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune By Amelia Gentleman TWITTER LINKEDIN SIGN IN TO E-MAIL PRINT SHARE NEW DELHI — Dengue fever has infected about 500 people in northern India and killed 14 exposing serious flaws within India's public health system. The Indian government called an emergency meeting of health officials Tuesday to try to control an outbreak of dengue fever that has infected about 500 people in northern India, overwhelming Delhi's hospitals and exposing serious flaws within the public health system. The city authorities were spraying high-risk areas with insecticide to kill the mosquitoes that carry the disease, but as the death toll rose to 14, doctors' associations criticized the government for a belated and ineffective response. There was chaos at Delhi's leading public hospital, the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, where doctors were forced to turn away suspected dengue cases because of a scarcity of beds and blood. People were being treated in corridors and in tents erected outside the building, and television reporters filming undercover within the building said the shortage of doctors on the dengue wards was so acute that patients were helping administer saline drips to each other. The hospital was itself struggling to contain an outbreak of the disease, attributed to the presence of stagnant pools of water on the surrounding campus where mosquitoes had been allowed to breed. One doctor died last week from the fever and 19 medical students and staff members have fallen ill. The inability of the government to cope with what is a relatively routine, annual phenomenon throws into harsh relief the crisis within India's medical system, illustrating how ill-equipped it is to meet basic public health needs. The rampant spread of the disease also offers a snapshot of the poor sanitation systems within the capital. In the post-monsoon period, Delhi is full of stagnating pools of water that offer ideal breeding grounds for mosquitos, and open sewers run through the city. 'We have failed miserably to get rid of the mosquito which carries this disease,' said Dr. Sanjiv Malik, national president of the Indian Medical Association, pointing out that public health officials had expected a resurgence of the disease this year, because of its three- or four-year recurrent cycle. 'The government failed to cover the open drains and sewage channels. They haven't fumigated properly, and public awareness campaigns are beginning only now, when the outbreak is under way. All this should have happened months ago.' Known as 'brain fever,' dengue fever is transmitted by the female Aedes mosquito, and symptoms include high temperatures, joint pains, vomiting and headaches. Severe cases can be fatal and there is no vaccine or specific treatment. The outbreak this year is unusually serious; a year ago, 217 cases of dengue had been registered in northern India, less than half the current figure. Officials warn that the outbreak is set to continue until mid-November, when the mosquito breeding period comes to an end. The city authorities threatened to fine individuals for failing to clean up potential breeding areas, warning that mosquitoes were liable to breed inside water cooling systems, used as a cheap alternative to air conditioners by large numbers of the capital's middle classes. There was widespread dismay at the reports of unhygienic conditions within one of the country's best medical institutes. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi said it issued 27 notices to All-India Institute of Medical Sciences in the past two months asking it to control mosquito breeding on its campus, the Hindustan Times reported. City officials were out in the hundreds at the beginning of the week, working on the public holiday marking Gandhi's birthday, to spray large swaths of the capital. 'We have also started random checks of homes, offices and places where there could be stagnant water,' a municipal health official, N.K. Yadav, told local media.",NA,NA,1,,,,,,,

Discover news with your friends. Give it a try. To get going, simply connect with your favourite social network: Facebook AN OUTBREAK of dengue fever has penetrated the residence of the Indian Prime Minister, infecting members of his family and putting pressure on his Government to declare an epidemic. The virus, which is carried by mosquitoes, has killed at least 38 people and infected 2,900 across the country since the end of the monsoon in August. The Government has resisted declaring an epidemic because it fears overwhelming its crowded hospitals and deterring foreign visitors at the start of the tourist high season. But the severity of the outbreak was highlighted yesterday when it was found to have penetrated the secluded Delhi residence of the Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh. His son-in-law, Vijay Tankha, and two grandsons, Rohan, 11, and Madhav, 17, were admitted to the leading hospital in India with dengue symptoms on Tuesday and Wednesday, sources said. They had developed the symptoms — a high fever, headache and muscle and joint pains — after a weekend gathering at Mr Singh’s residence, which has since been fumigated to kill all mosquitoes. They are being treated at the All India Institute of Medical Science, where doctors say they are in a stable condition. The institute is one of India’s most prestigious and well-equipped hospitals and should have been ready for a limited dengue outbreak. But it has now become the epicentre of the disease in Delhi, accounting for 16 of the 48 cases in the city, and raising questions about the state of the health system in India. Last Saturday one of the institute’s medical students died of dengue after the illness was misdiagnosed by a doctor in the outpatient ward. A television channel has broadcast hidden camera footage of overcrowded wards, overflowing rubbish bins and pools of stagnant water inside the institute. Anbumani Ramadoss, the Minister for Health, defended his handling of the outbreak. “Definitely we are tackling the situation. This is not an epidemic,” he said. “There is no need to panic.” Mr Ramadoss said that there had been 15 deaths and 670 cases in and around Delhi, but that the outbreak was not as serious as last year, when 157 people died of dengue nationwide. He blamed the Delhi outbreak on a construction boom that has left the capital dotted with thousands of unregulated building sites. - See more at: http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/dengue-fever-outbreak-reaches-indias-pm/story-e6frg6so-1111112319978#sthash.9vEtRJZf.dpuf",NA,NA,1,,,,,,,

17602,dengue,IND,7/14/2007 22:04,NA,"Mumbai, July 14: Two spells of heavy showers this season and the city has already recorded more than 20 deaths—among them, three are due to leptospirosis, three due to dengue and six due to malaria. There are also reports of several cholera and gastroenteritis cases. And civic hospitals, especially the ones in the suburbs, are already feeling the strain. From flooded entrances to leaking Operation Theatres, these peripheral hospitals are barely able to cope. When Newsline visited some, it was clear they were in no position to handle regular ailments, let alone face the challenges of a Mumbai monsoon. S K Patil Hospital, Malad (East): A water-logged welcome awaits visitors at the entrance, along with a broken wash basin. The stench of garbage combined with debris is overwhelming in this three-storeyed building, which is currently undergoing repairs. But patients keep coming in. Last week, the hospital admitted two with gastroenteritis and five with fever. This apart, it treated over 100 patients at its OPD. “We are not taking serious patients as we can’t handle them. We stabilise them and then send them to KEM or Bhagwati Hospital. Our OT has been shut for a while,” admitted a doctor. M W Desai Hospital, Malad (East): Here, the first floor has been shut for repairs, so the wards had to be shifted to the second and third floors. The only OT on the first floor is shut. “The ground floor ceiling has been leaking for a while. It’s not rain water, but water leaking from the top floors which may cause infections...we have complained, but no one pays heed,” said a hospital official. Seema Malik, chief medical superintendent for peripheral hospitals, BMC, said: “Both the hospitals are under repair. We have distributed diagnostic kits to all the hospitals according to their requirement.” Minor peripheral hospitals in the eastern suburbs are in the same state. Mahatma Phule Hospital, Vikhroli: In spite of major repair work done last year, the OT has been shut for two days due to leaks. Authorities have been forced to postpone surgeries. “There are four OTs in one big room—ophthalmology, orthopaedic, ENT and general surgery. Now, it is impossible for us to conduct scheduled orthopaedic surgeries as chances of infections are high,” said a doctor. Malik promised to look into it. “I am not aware of the status of repairs at Mahatma Phule Hospital. If leaks remain, we will take action,” she said. Bhagwati Hospital, Borivali: This one isn’t a minor peripheral hospital. But the second floor has been shut for over a year now due to leaks. During the recent heavy spells, even the medical superintendent’s office was flooded. Rajawadi Hospital, Ghatkopar: Part of the roof of the new OPD, inaugurated barely two months ago, collapsed due to the heavy rains. “Both Bhagwati Hospital and Cooper Hospital require urgent repairs. Major redevelopment plans have been drawn up for both, and these will take off in phases,” explained Malik",NA,NA,1,,,,,,,
19796,dengue,SGP,7/30/2007 12:24,NA,"HANOI, VIETNAM - Dengue fever is raging across Asia, prompting the World Health Organization to warn that the region could face the worst outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus in nearly a decade. The disease, commonly called the 'bone breaker' illness because of the excruciating joint pain it causes, has flared everywhere from ultramodern Singapore to poor Vietnam. There are four different types of dengue, but none have a cure or vaccine. Cambodia is now one of the most worrisome spots, where the disease has attacked about 25,000 people and killed nearly 300 children this year. That's about three times more than the number of cases for all of 2005, according to WHO. Sick children have overwhelmed ill-equipped hospitals there, forcing babies burning with fever to wait for beds outside with IV drips attached to their arms. The last major outbreak to hit Southeast Asia was in 1998, when about 350,000 cases were reported in the region, including nearly 1,500 deaths. Indonesia and Thailand were not included in that tally. John Ehrenberg, WHO's regional adviser on vector-borne diseases, said it could potentially reach that level this year. 'It looks like it might be a bad year,' he said. 'I think we're in the building-up stage, but it could very well peak by August or September.' Malaysia has seen a 50 percent jump in cases this year over the same period in 2006, with more than 1,000 patients admitted every week for the past month and 56 deaths recorded through June, according to Health Ministry figures. In Indonesia, more than 100,000 infections have been reported this year, including 1,100 deaths. That compares to 114,000 cases and the same number of fatalities for all of 2006, said Nyoman Kandun, a senior health ministry official who predicted the number will hit 200,000 by year's end. More than a dozen children infected with dengue filled beds in Jakarta's Tarakan Hospital. Some had IV drips in their hands while others had tubes in their noses. Muhammad Wildan, 5, was hospitalized last week and remained in critical condition due to internal bleeding. Doctors said he was lucky his family did not wait any longer to bring him in. 'It did not come to us that it was dengue,' said Padmi Sari, the boy's grandmother. 'We thought it was just a common fever.' Singapore, known for its spotless streets and cutting-edge health facilities, has not escaped dengue this year. The government has reported nearly 5,000 cases and at least three deaths. Early rains also caused a surge in cases in Thailand, with more than 20,000 cases reported through June, including 17 deaths. In Vietnam, which also typically logs a high number of annual cases, health officials have seen a 40 percent increase over last year, reporting more than 33,000 infections this year and 32 deaths. In addition to joint pain, rashes, nausea, severe headaches and high fever that typically accompany the disease, patients stricken with a more serious form, called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can experience internal bleeding, liver enlargement and circulatory shut down. 'You don't want to have people staying at home and starting to bleed,' Ehrenberg said. 'By the time they go to the hospital they're in shock and they will die.' The disease is not nearly as lethal as malaria, which kills more than 1 million people annually. But WHO estimates dengue infects up to 50 million people every year worldwide, mostly in Asia and Latin America. About a half million of those cases are severe, and some 19,000 deaths were recorded in 2002. 'We always think next year it will get better, but we always find next year it gets worse,' said Kroeger Axel, a dengue research coordinator at the WHO in Geneva. 'There's a very clear upward trend.' He said outbreaks run in cycles, occurring roughly every four years. Mosquitoes breed in stagnant pools of water ranging from flower pots to old tires, and residents across the region are urged to avoid letting water collect near houses. _ Associated Press reporters Heng Sinith in Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Sean Yoong in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Tran Van Minh in Hanoi, Vietnam, and Zakki Hakim in Jakarta, Indonesia contributed to this report.",NA,NA,1,,,,,,,

The money is arriving months late, long after the flood waters have subsided and the victims have been resettled, and after the rainy season cholera outbreaks have died down. According to Fabrizio Falcone, coordinator for health and social activities in the Italian Cooperation office in Mozambique, the money was disbursed 15 days ago, and will be used in Maputo, in the flood-hit central provinces of Sofala and Zambezia, and in Cabo Delgado in the far north. He told AIM the money would be used to improve sanitation, increase the availability of clean drinking water through opening new boreholes, and supporting peasant farmers who lost their crops to the floods. Some of the money will be used to acquire material that will strengthen the capacity of Mozambique's relief agency, the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), including the provision of four motor boats. Cholera and floods are, unfortunately, two disasters that occur cyclically in Mozambique , said Falcone. This year, after several requests presented by the Mozambican authorities, the Italian government decided to allocate a fund of a million euros to alleviate the difficulties of the people affected by these disasters . Falcone admitted there were delays in disbursing this sum because of bureaucratic questions on the part of the Italian government. But this situation has its positive side, because these resources will now be used in a more directed manner . He said that in Zambezia the aid will be channeled to Morrumbala district, to build a market for farmers to sell their goods, to distribute seeds for the next growing season, and to drill wells. These activities will absorb 210,000 euros. In Mocimboa da Praia district, in Cabo Delgado, 100,000 euros will be spent on supporting the government's sanitation campaign, and on improving the water supply and sanitation facilities at the district hospital. This should help minimize the risk of cholera in this area. Half the grant (500,000 euros) will be spent in Sofala, to build houses for some of the families displaced by the floods, and to rehabilitate the water system in the small town of Sena. Some of the money will be spent on reactivating the agricultural economy in Buzi and Machanga, which were also badly hit by flooding, and on sanitation campaigns. In Maputo, the funds will be spent on opening wells to supply schools and health units in outlying neighbourhoods with clean drinking water. Ensuring that the water supply is uncontaminated is one of the key measures for preventing cholera outbreaks. aggregates and indexes content from over 125 African news organizations , plus more than 200 other sources , who are responsible for their own reporting and views.

Even the state controlled Herald newspaper reports XXXXXX SW Radio Africa (London) 12 November 2008 Posted to the web 12 November 2008 We are increasingly receiving disturbing reports from across the country that more and more people are succumbing to cholera, as every aspect of Zimbabwean society collapses. Even the state controlled Herald newspaper reports seeing two trucks ferrying dead bodies from Budiriro, to an infectious disease mortuary on Tuesday. A reports from the north east border town of Nyamapanda says that bodies are being buried in very shallow (1 meter) graves, in council land adjacent to the mortuary in the town. An eye witness who had just travelled from Nyamapanda said: 'Flea market operators who go and set up stalls from Harare are sharing accommodation with unburied corpses.' A commentator added that it seems as if 'Robert Mugabe is quite content to turn the country into a giant death camp.' The former chairperson of the Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) Mike Davies, speaking in his private capacity, said people would not be dying from cholera if there were adequate resources, but the continuing deaths are a symptom of the failure of the regime to address the basic social needs of the citizens. Prevention of the disease is relatively easy with adequate water supplies and proper sanitation practices, but Zimbabwe has now become a breeding ground for this infectious disease. There is no clean water in most parts of the country, resulting in many desperate people scrounging for water from unprotected wells and streams, in spite of the cholera outbreak. With the collapse of the health industry and most hospitals now being shut, many people are just dying at home, making it very difficult to come up with statistics. The government has also been downplaying the extent of the crisis. Furthermore the fact that there is still no government in place in Zimbabwe makes the situation even more abnormal. On Wednesday the Herald newspaper could not hide the extent of the crisis. The paper wrote: 'The Harare City Council yesterday remained mum as cholera continued to take its toll. Yesterday afternoon The Herald witnessed two trucks ferrying bodies of cholera victims from Budiriro Polyclinic to Beatrice Road Infectious Diseases Hospital mortuary.' A number of areas in the capital have been without water for several weeks and yet residents are still being forced to pay their rates. Some areas like Mabvuku and Tafara have gone for half a year without water. Meanwhile a CHRA statement accuses the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) of gross incompetence, which has resulted in the cholera scourge that has claimed lives in Budiriro, Glenview, Glen Norah Dzivarasekwa and Chitungwiza. 'In the traditional fashion of the arm-twisting of state institutions for partisan and self gratification, the ZANU PF Government defied all reason and went ahead with the ZINWA takeover of water and sewer management from the local authorities in 2006. The decision has resulted in untold water inadequacies and subsequent disease outbreaks and deaths from cholera and other related diseases, in the light of the collapsed health sector,' said the statement. However ZINWA blames the crisis on a lack of spare parts and foreign currency to buy chemicals needed to purify the water. Davies says that until there is a legitimate government in the country, elected by the people, there will be no change in the situation. He also noted the failure of leadership in the opposition, to galvanise the anger from people who have now been reduced to an animal existence. aggregates and indexes content from over 125 African news organizations , plus more than 200 other sources , who are responsible for their own reporting and views.

The bag of 5 per cent dextrose fluid going into her arm had to be tied to the metal window frame, in which half the panes were broken, because the isolation camp had no drip stands. But 19-year-old Kitty was fortunate, in more ways than one. The high-school student was the only cholera patient in the camp, set up in two derelict brick houses in a remote area of the Zambezi River valley, to have a bed. Other patients had to lie on the floor, with just a blanket between them and the bare concrete. Save the Children had donated two special cholera beds, which can easily be disinfected between patients, but a 60-year-old woman had died in the other one earlier in the day. Her body lay on the floor in another room, wrapped in blankets. Cholera is extremely infectious Kitty and her grandfather, also a patient in the camp, had both contracted the disease at the funeral of another victim but easily treatable if caught in time. 'I feel better already,' said the young woman, just over 12 hours after she was admitted. Nobody had the heart, however, to tell her that her grandfather was not expected to last the day. Like many older patients, he had suffered kidney failure, caused by acute dehydration. It is a measure of Zimbabwe's collapse under President Robert Mugabe that cholera has been allowed to get out of control. Last week his government finally stopped playing down the worst epidemic in decades, and declared a national emergency. More than 12,000 people have been infected, and nearly 600 have died, according to official figures, but health professionals believe the real totals are much higher. Food shortages and economic collapse have crippled the country's health services so badly that many unrecorded deaths are thought to have occurred in remote areas, beyond the reach of treatment. Nor is that the only reason why the disease has taken hold. In several cases, starving rural people have failed to report suspected cases of cholera, because they know that the authorities will immediately ban public gatherings, and wrongly believe that this will extend to food distributions. Only when victims start dying does the news get out, and by then infection has spread far and wide. Cholera is endemic in parts of Mashonaland West, and there are well-established procedures for dealing with the disease, which usually makes its appearance much later in the rainy season, in March or April. Isolation camps are immediately set up at the scene of an outbreak, and are not closed until 14 days after the last case is declared over. But one rural doctor said there was simply not enough food for the staff, let alone the patients, to set up the number of camps required in his area. 'We are just firefighting,' he said. Steady rain was falling as we arrived at Kitty's isolation camp, set up next to a clinic that had never been completed, because desperate local people had stolen building materials to sell for food. Before entering, we had to retie our shoelaces to ensure they did not brush the floor, and afterwards our shoes were disinfected. Only a timely donation of maize meal from Save the Children had allowed this camp to stay open, but Kitty's luck did not end there. Unlike one family, in which a woman lost her mother and three of her four children in two days, the 19-year-old had recognised her symptoms straight away, and when she arrived, the camp had enough intravenous fluids and antibiotics to treat her. The doctor said he knew of at least two cases of patients dying because supplies of fluid had run out, and after the first few cases, the local laboratory had exhausted its supply of the reagents needed to test patients for cholera. 'I must be the most frustrated doctor in Zimbabwe,' he said. If anything, conditions are even worse in the urban areas. Roughly half the deaths have been in the capital, Harare, where sewage runs down the streets in many poor districts. The water supply has been cut off to much of the city, because the municipality cannot pay for the chemicals to treat it. With monthly salaries for medical staff barely covering the cost of a single day's bus fare to and from work, all Harare's hospitals have ceased functioning. Last week riot police broke up a demonstration by doctors and nurses demanding better pay and conditions. Even if a massive infusion of international aid brings the cholera outbreak under control, however, doctors fear that an equally fatal epidemic of malaria will soon follow. In a tropical country such as Zimbabwe, some cases of malaria can be expected every year. But in the low-lying Zambezi Valley there used to be a network of modestly paid community health workers who would cut the grass in which mosquitoes breed, and spray each house ahead of the summer rains, helping to keep the disease under control. That system broke down a couple of years ago, and the number of cases shot up last summer. With this year's rains, the sitation is expected to be even worse. Another deadly disease, anthrax, has already made an appearance in north-western Zimbabwe, and has spread from animals to humans, because hungry villagers have eaten the meat of infected cattle. At least three people have died in the worst anthrax outbreak since the liberation war of the 1970s. More deaths are likely, because administrative disarray means the strict quarantine and slaughter system needed to defeat the disease is unlikely to be implemented. Inoculation of livestock against the disease all but stopped five years ago. All these health disasters are on top of the ravages of HIV/Aids. Zimbabwe has one of the highest infection rates in the world, but progress was being made. Thanks to huge efforts by the Global Fund, anti-retroviral drugs have been widely distributed, but they are ineffective unless the person taking them is adequately fed. In every case it is the children who are most vulnerable. David and Tambu's nine-year-old daughter Sarah showed symptoms of cholera at 4am, and by the same evening she was dead probably, according to a doctor, because she was undernourished and had latent malaria as well. 'She had been playing with children from a village where there was cholera,' said David, who carried Sarah on his back for three hours to reach the nearest clinic. 'We all went to church on Sunday, and on Monday she was dead. If the clinic here had still been running, perhaps she might have lived, but it closed a long time ago.' For Tambu, who was heavily pregnant with another child, the cruellest blow was that her daughter's body was returned to them encased in heavy plastic, to prevent infection. 'If I had at least been able to see her one more time, it would have helped me grieve,' she said. 'I don't know how to tell the other children what has happened.' Her fears for the family are growing, because they are dependent on food handouts. 'We have traded our cooking pots for something to eat, and have nothing left to barter with,' she said. 'If no more food comes, we will die.' The doctor, who had been unable to save Sarah's life, said: 'Cholera, malaria and deaths in childbirth are all easily preventable. Save the Children is a very strong pillar for us compared with other districts, we lose far fewer people to these causes.' Never, though, have the ordinary people of Zimbabwe been in greater need than now, and we are their only source of hope.

It is common in crowded, insanitary environments, such as pre-20th-century London. * One of the earliest breakthroughs in public health came when a cholera outbreak was traced to an infected well in Soho, London, in 1854. * The disease causes massive diarrhoea and vomiting in its most virulent form, leading to dehydration and kidney failure.

Even then, he said, the lack of clean drinking water means that cholera will be endemic in Zimbabwe. XXXXXX Health body, MSF, warns on Zimbabwe cholera HE international medical charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), predicts that the cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe will last well into 2009. Manuel Lopez, the head of MSF in the country, told the BBC the epidemic was still at a critical level and would not subside until the rains end in March. Even then, he said, the lack of clean drinking water means that cholera will be endemic in Zimbabwe. The disease has claimed 1,123 lives and infected more than 20,000 people. Lopez lamented that many clinics and hospitals have closed that large sections of the population have no access to medical care. 'The ministry of health has declared a national emergency,' said Lopez. 'So it is very clear that the situation is very, very critical in terms of health people's access to health care.' Latest UN figures include a new outbreak of hundreds of cases in Chegutu, near the capital Harare, which has been worst hit by the disease. MSF says that when it arrived in Chegutu 10 days ago, it found the local facilities completely overwhelmed. Patients were lying on the floor, some next to dead bodies, sanitation services were non-existent, and there was no water and no food to be found. 'The situation was absolute chaos,' said Luis Maria Tello, the MSF Emergency Team Medical Coordinator. 'There were no beds and patients everywhere. People were dying of thirst because there was no water.' The disposal of the dead was one of the first priorities set by the emergency team. 'Dead people were lying everywhere,' said Tello. The easily preventable disease has spread because of the collapse of health services and water sanitation in Zimbabwe. The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) has said the total number of cases could reach 60,000 unless the epidemic is stopped. A week ago, Mr. Mugabe said the outbreak had been 'arrested'. He claimed Western powers wanted to use an epidemic as an excuse to invade Zimbabwe and topple him. Meanwhile, South African ruling ANC leader, Jacob Zuma said in a radio interview there was no reason for sending troops to Zimbabwe. 'Why military intervention when there is no war?' he told South Africa's 702 Talk Radio. 'We should be pressurising them to see the light.' Zimbabwe claimed earlier this week that Botswana, which has joined growing international calls for Mugabe to quit, was hosting military training camps for MDC rebels. But the current chairperson of the Southern African Development Community, South African President Kgalema Motlanthe, said on Wednesday: 'We never believed that.'

In the past two months, 78 cases of the potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus have been confirmed in Cairns and in a separate outbreak, two people have been struck down in Townsville. Public health specialist Jeffrey Hanna said the Cairns outbreak, which has been traced to an international traveller, is already stretching the capacity of medics and extra staff have had to be employed. Dr Hanna said three teams were working on implementing mosquito control measures but even if that number was doubled, 'We'd still have a problem.' 'We have a dengue-friendly city here in Cairns. We're finding a lot of mosquito breeding in the properties we visit,' he said. 'This outbreak clearly has a momentum about it. I expect it's going to be several months before it's overcome.' Dr Hanna said the weather in Cairns had been 'perfect for the mosquito' this season with high temperatures, humidity and rain. The worsening situation in north Queensland comes as scientists expressed fears the virus could return to the state's southeast for the first time in more than 60 years. University of Queensland biologist Scott O'Neill, who is working on a promising new way to prevent the virus, said the recent policy of offering rebates to encourage water tank use had potentially placed the state's southeast at risk of future dengue outbreaks. His concerns were echoed by Stephen Prowse, the Brisbane-based CEO of the Australian Biosecurity Co-operative Research Centre for Emergency Infectious Disease. 'We do need to be careful about dengue spreading further south than it currently is,' Professor Prowse said. 'There needs to be a good understanding of the risks associated with water tanks. 'When tanks are installed, they're supposed to be mosquito proof. They should be checked regularly to make sure they remain mosquito proof.' Mr O'Neill said that in the short term, tanks were probably secure and not breeding mosquitoes. 'But it doesn't take very long, if the maintenance is not kept up on them, for them to become breeding sites for the dengue mosquito,' he said. The north Queensland dengue outbreaks are the state's worst since the 2003-04 season when more than 800 people were infected with the potential killer. Two Torres Strait Islanders who developed the most severe form of the disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever, died during that year's outbreak. Dr Hanna would not speculate if the 2008-09 season was shaping up to be as severe. 'I'm not very good at crystal ball gazing,' he said. Several people have had to be admitted to hospital in the latest dengue outbreak, some telling doctors that 'they've never felt so sick in their life'. 'It makes many people feel absolutely dreadful,' Dr Hanna said. 'They're laid so low they can't look after themselves. 'I'm absolutely sure if it wasn't for our quality of care through our general practitioners, community health centres, ambulance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and our public hospitals, we'd have a much more serious problem in terms of outcome.'

The death toll has risen to 2,225, with a cumulative cases increasing to 42,675, according to a latest update from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The agency said 689 cases and 24 deaths were added on Thursday, while 1,550 cases and 104 deaths were added the day before. All 10 of Zimbabwe's provinces or 87.1 percent of its Districts are now affected by the epidemic, which broke out in mid August 2008. 'A main concern is the rise of community deaths (not in a health facility) in comparison to deaths within a health facility,' said Elisabeth Byrs, OCHA's spokesperson. According to OCHA, the expected results of the massive awareness raising campaigns and distribution of prevention materials such as water purification tablets and curative materials such as Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS) sachets are yet to be felt. The meltdown of economic and social infrastructures in Zimbabwe prevent people from having access to safe water and adhere to proper hygiene practices, resulting in infection and re-infection of large parts of the population, in particular in the rural areas. There are also other major challenges, such as the lack of funding for government-run cholera treatment centers, the lack of logistical capacity, the lack of fuel and transport, and the coming of the flood and cyclone season. Zimbabweans urged to concentrate on battle against cholera HARARE, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The success recorded in the fight against cholera so far should not distract the country and its partners from intensifying efforts to thwart the outbreak, as more still needs to be done, Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare Minister David Parirenyatwa has said.

New United Nations figures show that the number of people infected has shot up to 69000 cases, 9000 more than the 60000 XXXXXX 09 February 2009 While politicians attempt to put together a shaky power-sharing deal the country s deadly cholera epidemic shows no sign of let up. New United Nations figures show that the number of people infected has shot up to 69000 cases, 9000 more than the 60000 thought to be a worst case scenario. Recent estimates suggest that figure could go up even further to 100,000. The World Health Organisation says that 3397 people have died since August last year, when the disease broke out. But that figure is highly unreliable, given it is based on records of the number of people who have gone through formal treatment centres something most Zimbabweans do not have access to. The outbreak is already being ranked as the deadliest in Africa for almost 15 years and highlights the complete breakdown of the health delivery system, in what is now a prime example of a failed state. While the state focused on shoring up its repressive machinery by purchasing guns, jets, anti-riot equipment and luxury perks for top security officials, the basics for society were ignored - such as water, sanitation and health delivery. Cholera, which is an easily treatable disease, has spread rapidly on account of this breakdown. With no chemicals to treat water, infection rates have remained high. Last year in December Mugabe stunned the world when he claimed that cholera had been arrested despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The World Health Organisation in a recent bulletin warned that the death rate in Zimbabwe is unusally high and that on average more than 5 percent of those infected are dying. The experts say in cases where the outbreak is well-managed, only 1 percent of those infected normally die. On Saturday the UN announced that it would be conducting a humanitarian mission in Zimbabwe. A delegation of experts will study ways of controlling the on-going epidemic, after Mugabe gave permission for them to do so. There are currently over 200 cholera treatment centres, half of which are run by different groups falling under the World Health Organisation. Despite donations to help with the epidemic, a good number of items like water purification tablets and other cholera treatment kits are snaking their way onto the black market, via corrupt government officials. It s thought several people in the regime have made a fortune out of the tragedy. Various shops in the major cities are actually selling donated items on their shelves, while the clinics who should be the recipients say they have nothing in stock.

XXXXXX Madibeng hit by cholera outbreak Two people have died from cholera and six more are being treated for the disease at the Madibeng fire station in Brits. Eighteen more people are currently being treated for diarrhea and the North West Department of Health is awaiting test results that will determine whether these patients also suffer from cholera. The two farm labourers from the Sanddrift area outside Brits died over the weekend and by Monday 16 labourers from the same farm had been admitted to the Brits District Hospital with diarrhea. That number increased to 24 from different farms in the same area by Tuesday night. The North West Department of Health assembled an Outbreak Response Team and in cooperation with the Local Municipality of Madibeng decided to move the patients to the fire station in Brits where there is a larger hall where they could be treated. The reason for this was that the Brits District Hospital is currently housed at temporary premises where they do not have the capacity to treat such a large number of patients. Mr. Ngwako Motsieng, spokes-person for the North West Department of Health, said that the man and woman died from dehydration which resulted in kidney failure. Dr Andrew Robinson, Deputy Director General: Health Services for the North West Department of Health, told Kormorant that the 26 patients, including the two patients who died, came from different farms in the Sanddrift area. He said that tests on the borehole water in the area showed no indication that the illnesses were a result of the water but that the sanitation and living conditions in the area could be conducive to the spreading of the disease. Dr. Robinson said that the influx of patients with the same symptoms seemed to have stopped by Tuesday night. Mr. Peet Rheeders, a farmer from Sanddrift in whose employ the two deceased were, told Kormorant that although they stopped the use of the borehole where employees got water from as soon as they learnt what happened, the disease could also have been contracted from mourners from elsewhere in the country who attended two recent funerals on the farm. He said that he had taken samples of the water from the borehole and that he will have the samples independently tested to ensure that the water is safe for consumption. Rheeders said on Monday that they were shocked by the deaths of the two labourers and that they were taking all employees who present any symptoms of illness for medical treatment. Dr. Robinson confirmed that the department is looking into the possibility that the disease could have been contracted at the funerals. According to the National Department of Health s Guidelines for Cholera Control the disease can be caused in mainly four different ways. These are: Drinking water that has been contaminated at its source, during storage or usage, Contaminated foods, vegetables that have been fertilised with human excreta (nightsoil) or freshened with contaminated water, Soiled hands that can contaminate clean drinking water and food, and Fish, particularly shellfish taken from contaminated water and eaten raw or insufficiently cooked. The North West Department of Health urged residents to take precautionary measures such as washing their hands with soap and water every time after using the toilet, after changing babies nappies and when preparing food. The department also advised that those residents using untreated water and anyone at risk to purify their water with a teaspoon of household bleach to five litres of water or to mix one capful of household bleach with 20 to 25 litres of water and to let it stand for at least two hours (preferably overnight) before consumption.

565090,cholera,HTI,10/28/2010 15:06,NA,"Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is treating more than 100 new patients with cholera-like symptoms every day in Petite Riviere, a city in the Artibonite River region north of Port-au-Prince. An MSF team arrived at a government-run health center that was in need of support last week and immediately began treating patients with symptoms including watery diarrhea. Confirming cholera requires lab testing, but the treatment for cholera and watery diarrhea are the same, beginning with rehydration. On October 27, 156 new patients were admitted to the center, and 177 were discharged. At the end of the day, staff were treating 179 patients. Aurelie Ponthieu is the MSF field coordinator in Petite Riviere. She explained what the team is doing now and what their concerns are as the outbreak continues. How is treatment progressing in Petite Riviere? The treatment is working fine and we see a lot of improvement in the patients since we came here five days ago. We arrived in a very overcrowded, overloaded health center that we came to relieve, and there were many patients needing treatment. Today, October 26, we discharged 212 patients—that’s a lot and it’s good because people are coming to the medical facility and they usually recover in two days. On average, we have been receiving about 150 new patients every day and today was the same. Do you have a sense of whether the outbreak is slowing down? It is hard to say whether the situation is improving or deteriorating because we’ve only been here for five days. When you open a treatment center, people start coming and we don’t know where they were before. So it’s hard to have a good analysis at the moment. We also heard today that in the rural areas other health centers are receiving cases as well. Are patients coming in early enough to get treated? We have a bit of everything. We have people coming at the very, very early stage, which is good. But we also have people coming too late, meaning in very severe condition. Not many—there have been fewer deaths since we have been here. But those who come at a very late stage, you have to take care of them quickly. Mainly, watery diarrhea and cholera treatment are about hydration. Normally, if the treatment goes well and the person has no complications, in two days the person is cured and can go home. It’s very quick. How is MSF working with the Ministry of Health and with other organizations in Petite Riviere? We came here to support the Ministry of Health—the health center was treating these patients when we arrived. They were overloaded because they were lacking staff and supplies, and did not really know the protocol, since cholera is relatively new in Haiti. It has not been here for at least 60 years. So of course they needed help. We are working in collaboration with the ministry and with Partners in Health, another non-governmental organization, which was supporting the health structure before the outbreak. So we have partners here and the collaboration is good. Our main concern at the moment is that this outbreak, with the resources it demands, does not keep people from receiving treatment for other medical issues. It is already very difficult to find medical staff to help treat patients, and, of course other health needs still exist. In this clinic there is also a maternity ward, so we are organizing a separate area for patients with cholera or watery diarrhea where we will be able to provide treatment and avoid having a negative impact on the maternity needs and other medical needs that exist in the area. So, that is our biggest worry at the moment: how to ensure medical care if this outbreak continues in the future. What will the team do next? For the moment we are concentrating on treating people with cholera-like symptoms. But the next priority is to actually get out of the city and go look for patients. We will also do health promotion: teaching prevention so people will know how to not catch and spread cholera, and what to do if they have such symptoms. There are other organizations doing health promotion right now and we try to share information with them—such as where our patients come from, so they can go to those communities. And this information-sharing will also help us find out where we can have an impact.",NA,NA,1,,,,,,,

A team from Management Sciences for Health in Medford arrived in Liberia this week to work with the Liberian government and other community leaders to identify gaps and unmet needs. 'Our immediate priorities are to work with government and community leaders to stop a health system collapse in Liberia, to prevent the epidemic from spreading to nearby nations and to restore Liberians' trust in their health system,' President Dr. Jonathan Quick said. The organization says Ebola cases are doubling every two weeks in Liberia. The disease, with a mortality rate of about 50 percent, has killed at least 3,800 people in West Africa with no signs of abating. 'It is likely that we will see more deaths from non-Ebola diseases and conditions than from Ebola itself if we don't get the health system back up and functioning,' said Dr. Fred Hartman, the group's pandemic preparedness and infectious diseases expert. 'At the moment, most Ebola patients have nowhere to go for effective treatment. The health system has been overwhelmed by the outbreak and many essential health services have stopped.' The organization also has an Ebola preparedness presence in Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Nigeria.

178631,influenza,USA,4/25/2009 19:19,NA,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) says a new strain of the flu virus, suspected of killing more than 60 people in Mexico, is a potential pandemic. The WHO says the outbreak is already an international public health emergency. The deadly swine flu strain has been found in three Mexican cities and in the US border states of California and Texas, but new reports suggest it may also have reached as far as Kansas and New York. The WHO tends to err on the side of caution, but director-general Margaret Chan says it has 'pandemic potential'. Ms Chan says the outbreak remains unpredictable and she has urged countries around the world to share information. 'This is a serious situation, which must be watched very closely,' she said. 'We do not yet have a complete picture of the epidemiology or the risks including possible spread beyond the currently affected areas.' WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl says countries are being urged to step up their surveillance. 'We don't have as I said, enough evidence yet to say for sure if this is a pandemic virus because we don't know how well it translates from generation to generation,' he said. In Mexico at least 60 people are dead and more than 1,000 have fallen ill. Nine people in California and Texas have fallen sick, but all have recovered. While the flu usually kills the sick and the elderly, this outbreak is killing young healthy adults. Mexican authorities are taking the outbreak seriously, stopping public events, closing schools and even having soldiers hand out free face masks on Mexico City streets. Mexican President Felipe Calderon has issued an emergency decree, giving authorities special powers to isolate sick people, enter homes or workplaces and regulate air, sea and land transportation to try to stop further infection. The flu has rattled residents of Mexico's overcrowded capital of some 20 million people. Mr Calderon tried to calm Mexicans earlier on Saturday, saying the virus was curable. He said health authorities easily had enough antiviral medicine for the 1,000 or so people suspected to be infected with the swine flu and that his government was monitoring the situation 'minute by minute.' Reports from New York, Kansas At least eight students at a New York City high school are likely to have swine flu, but it is unclear whether they have strain which has proved deadly in Mexico. City health officials say at least 75 students at the school have come down with a fever, sore throat and other aches and pains. Samples have been sent to the US Centre for Disease Control for further testing. New York health commissioner Dr Thomas Frieden says the children are recovering. 'In every single case, illness was mild,' he said. 'Many of the children are feeling better, no child has been hospitalised, no child was seriously ill.' He says the scale of the outbreak is nowhere near the one in Mexico. 'If we were to see as they've seen in Mexico City a large number of people becoming seriously ill with flu, that would be a very different situation from what we have now,' he said. 'What we have is a relatively large number of students at one school all of whom have mild illness.' Kansas state health officials have also confirmed two cases of swine flu. They say two adults were carrying the virus, adding that one of the victims was still ill and another had recovered. 'One of the patients had recently travelled to Mexico,' a statement said. 'Both persons ... became ill with the same unique strain of swine flu that has been identified in Mexico, California and Texas.' A spokesman from the US Centre for Disease Control, Tom Skinner, says little is currently known about the new flu strain. 'How widespread and what the impact this will ultimately have on health is too early to tell,' he said. 'We have a new virus. We have a virus that's being transferred from person to person. We don't know how well or efficiently this virus is spreading and how easily it's going to be sustained in the human population.' Traveller checks A British Airways cabin crew member has also been taken to hospital in England as a precaution, after developing flu-like symptoms on a flight from Mexico City. The man has undergone tests, but has not yet been notified of the results. No other crew members or passengers on the BA242 flight into Heathrow Airport were detained. As far away as Hong Kong and Japan, health officials stepped up checks of travellers with flu-like symptoms. In Colombia, health officials are monitoring five people who arrived from Mexico with flu symptoms. The country's health minister has also ordered strict check points set up in Colombia's port facilities and airports to monitor arrivals from Mexico and the United States.",NA,NA,0,,,,,,,

The case has dashed hopes that while Ebola continues to spread fast in the western area encompassing the capital Freetown, the eastern region where the crisis first emerged had beaten the virus. 'After zero cases reported for the past 26 days, the eastern town had an Ebola death involving a woman who had visited the city 10 days ago and started feeling sick,' health ministry spokesman Abass Kamara told AFP. 'She was treated at the Kenema government hospital but her Ebola status was not detected and she later died. When a swab was taken, it was found out that she was Ebola positive.' The spread of the virulent tropical pathogen appears to be slowing in neighbouring Liberia, which has set itself the goal of eradicating the virus by the end of the year. But transmission remains 'intense' in Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization, with more than 1,200 lives lost since the first cases in the east. Kamara said 11 nurses who treated the new case had been placed in quarantine.

During May 2009, a few weeks after 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection was first detected in the United States, 1 outbreaks among students from two schools were detected in Greenwich, Connecticut. Staff members from Greenwich Hospital and the Connecticut Department of Public Health collected data on symptoms for 63 patients and submitted nasopharyngeal washings for testing using a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) for influenza A and B and real-time reverse transcription&#8211;polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay, thereby affording an opportunity to assess the field performance of the RIDT. A total of 49 patients had infections with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) confirmed by rRT-PCR. This report summarizes the findings from this performance assessment, which indicated that, compared with rRT-PCR, the sensitivity of the RIDT for detecting infection in patients with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was 47%, and the specificity was 86%. Sensitivity and specificity did not vary substantially by the presence or absence of CDC-defined influenza-like illness (ILI) or by time from symptom onset to specimen acquisition. In this group of patients, although positive RIDT results performed well in predicting confirmed infection with pandemic H1N1 virus (positive predictive value: 92%), negative tests did not accurately predict the absence of infection (negative predictive value: 32%). These results affirm recent CDC recommendations against using negative RIDT results for management of patients with possible 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection. 2 During April 29&#8211;May 1, 2009, 78 students from a private school (school A) near Greenwich, Connecticut, participated in a class trip to Pennsylvania. Several students became sick with a respiratory illness. Because infection with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was suspected, upon returning home, 11 of the students, a sibling, and two other students went to the Greenwich Hospital for outpatient influenza testing and treatment. During May 18-20, 133 students and eight teachers from a public school (school B) in Greenwich traveled to a camp in Connecticut. Among these students, 36 visited the camp infirmary with fever, headache, or fatigue. The Greenwich Health Department asked physicians at the hospital to assist with testing the students for pandemic H1N1. A total of 67 students and staff from school B became ill, and 49 of these patients went to the hospital for influenza testing. A total of 63 patients (14 students from school A and 49 students and staff from school B) were tested for influenza at the hospital. A standard symptom survey was completed by a physician for each patient after which a nasopharyngeal washing was performed by an experienced respiratory therapist trained in the procedure. All samples were placed in viral transport media and sent to the Connecticut Department of Public Health laboratory for influenza virus detection by rRT-PCR. Rapid screening for influenza A and B was performed concurrently at the hospital laboratory using the Remel Xpect Flu A&amp;B test (Remel Products, Lenexa, Kansas) according to manufacturer's instructions. 3 Although the number of ill persons who eventually received antiviral therapy is unknown, all nasopharyngeal washings were obtained before initiation of therapy. Of the 63 patients tested by RIDT, 49 patients, 11 (79%) from school A and 38 (78%) from school B, were found to have 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection by rRT-PCR. Of the 49 patients with confirmed infection, 23 (47%) tested positive (eight from school A and 15 from school B) and 26 (53%) tested negative for 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) by RIDT. Among 11 patients with positive rRT-PCR tests from school A and 38 from school B, the numbers of positive RIDT tests were 8 (73%) and 15 (39%) respectively. Among the 14 patient samples from both schools that tested negative by rRT-PCR, three were from students at school A, and 11 were from school B. Of the 14 rRT-PCR negative specimens, two tested positive by RIDT (one from school A and one from school B). The overall sensitivity of the RIDT was 23 of 49 (47%), and the specificity was 12 of 14 (86%). The positive predictive value was 23 of 25 (92%), and the negative predictive value was 12 of 38 (32%). The schools did not differ significantly with respect to percentage of patients with confirmed pandemic H1N1 by rRT-PCR, severity of symptoms, interval between the onset of symptoms and collection of specimens for testing, or overall RIDT positivity rate. Among all the patients tested by RIDT, no significant differences between true positives and false negatives were seen with respect to ILI.* In RIDT positive and RIDT negative patients with pandemic H1N1, the median interval from symptom onset to specimen collection was 36 hours. Of the 34 patients with washings obtained 36 hours from the onset of symptoms, 16 (47%) were RIDT positive; of the 15 patients with washings collected after 36 hours of symptoms, seven (47%) were positive. RIDT test performance was assessed for patients with and without CDC-defined ILI. The sensitivity and specificity were approximately the same for the two groups (48% versus 44% and 88% versus 83%, respectively). JR Sabetta, MD, J Smardin, L Burns, MPH, K Barry, MS, Greenwich Hospital Section of Infectious Diseases; C Baisley, MPH, T Mahoney, MS, D Travers, MSN, Greenwich Dept of Health; T Brennan, J Fontana, PhD, Connecticut Dept of Public Health Laboratory; T Rabatsky-Ehr, MPH, ML Cartter, MD, Connecticut Dept of Public Health. When cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) began appearing in the United States in April 2009, several RIDTs had been in common use in the United States as point-of-care tests for seasonal influenza, but the performance of these tests in patients infected with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus was unknown. CDC has since reported varying sensitivities of RIDTs in retrospective analyses of rRT-PCR positive respiratory samples, from 40%-69%. In these analyses, RIDT sensitivity was positively associated with the titer of virus in the sample. 4 The analysis in this report of pandemic H1N1 cases at two schools determined that the RIDT used detected less than half the cases confirmed by rRT-PCR. The low sensitivity and low negative predictive value of the test during these outbreaks highlight the limitations of using this test alone to establish diagnosis and aid clinical management. These results affirm current recommendations not to use negative RIDT results to rule out pandemic H1N1 or to make infection control decisions. 2 Rapid tests differ in their sensitivity and specificity for detecting seasonal influenza in respiratory specimens but generally have low to moderate sensitivity compared with viral culture or rRT-PCR. Previous RIDT studies have described the performance of the QuickVue Influenza A+B test (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, California) for detecting seasonal influenza in three different populations during 2008. Sensitivity when compared with rRT-PCR was low for all populations (median: 27%; range: 19%-32%). 5 The RIDT used in the current study has a reported sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 100% for the diagnosis of seasonal influenza A by nasopharyngeal wash. 3 This investigation yielded much lower sensitivity (47%) and specificity (86%) in patients having confirmed infection with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. The findings in this report are comparable to recently reported observations of low performance of RIDTs in patients with pandemic H1N1. In a report of hospitalized patients in California, rapid antigen test results were positive in 67% of cases of pandemic H1N1 tested. 6 In an assessment of rapid testing compared with rRT-PCR conducted on 6,090 patient samples from the New York City area, the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus by rapid antigen testing, using the BinaxNOW Influenza A&amp;B test (Binax, Inc., Scarborough, Maine) and the 3M Rapid Detection Flu A+B test (3M, St. Paul, Minnesota) were 17.8% and 93.6% respectively. 7 A recent report from the Naval Health Research Center described screening 3,066 clinical samples from service personal with influenza-like illness; of those screened, 767 rapid test results by QuickVue Influenza A+B test were available for comparison with rRT-PCR results. 8 Of 39 patients with pandemic H1N1, 20 were RIDT positive, with a 51% sensitivity; for seasonal influenza A the sensitivity was 63% for H1N1 and 31% for H3N2. Specificity was 99% for all three subtypes when compared with rRT-PCR. The results of these studies and the findings in this report affirm that a negative result for this rapid test does not rule out 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in an individual with symptoms consistent with influenza. Factors that might decrease the performance of rapid influenza antigen tests include improper specimen collection, not testing the recommended clinical sample (e.g., nasal versus nasopharyngeal swab), quality of the specimen, prolonged time from illness onset to specimen collection (because viral shedding decreases over time), and improper handling and storage of the specimen before testing. The reason for the suboptimal detection of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) by the RIDT used in this study was not specifically determined but did not appear to be related to differences in the interval (median: 36 hours for both groups) from onset of symptoms to specimen collection or to the severity of symptoms. As with all screening tests, the positive and negative predictive values of RIDTs are dependent on the prevalence of the disease in the population. The findings in this report are subject to at least one limitation. The assessment involved a limited number of patients from two small outbreaks. The results should be viewed in this context. In other field situations (e.g., with other disease prevalences, collection and transport methods, or using other RIDTs), RIDTs might have different performance characteristics. RIDTs can be an important tool for patient care during the normal influenza season because they usually provide results within 30 minutes. In addition, these tests can be used to make decisions about isolating or cohorting patients in health-care settings and recommending or restricting patient movements in outpatient settings. They might be especially important for hospitals limited by the expense of rRT-PCR and in identifying influenza during outbreaks in defined patient groups, such as those in schools or nursing homes. However, if used for management of patients with possible pandemic H1N1 virus infection, false-negative test reports might result in inappropriate exposure of susceptible persons to infected patients. Additional large studies to better characterize the performance of RIDTs for detection of infection in patients with pandemic H1N1 virus and improvements in rapid testing for pandemic H1N1 are needed. The findings in this report are based, in part, on data provided by the Westchester County Dept of Health, New Rochelle, New York. *CDC ILI surveillance case definition: fever ( 100&#176;F [ 37.8&#176;C]), plus cough, sore throat, or both in the absence of another known CDC.

She was there for six weeks, from June 14 to Aug. 2, before flying back to the United States with 47 other Peace Corps volunteers after the current Ebola outbreak began to gather momentum. “Ebola is very, very difficult to get,” she said. “You have to be in extremely close contact. That’s why most of the people who are getting it are health care workers.” But Peace Corps administrators were taking no chances and ordered all the volunteers back home. For Monnier, it meant an unexpected hiatus from the two years she has committed to teaching math and science to Liberian children in Kakata, a city of some 33,000 people about 45 miles northeast of the Liberian capital of Monrovia, where the Ebola outbreak has been especially virulent. Monnier, a 2010 graduate of Bellevue West High School, who graduated from Concordia University in May with a bachelor’s degree in business marketing and administration, said she never felt in danger. “We weren’t allowed to go to hospitals or clinics, and they kept us up to date on how things were progressing,” she said. “The last two weeks it began picking up, and so did our concern. Things happened super fast. We found out on the Wednesday that we were going home, and 48 of us were on a flight home Friday morning.” Patrice Monnier, Rebecca’s mother, said she feels an inevitable ambivalence about her 22-year-old daughter returning to Liberia. “I’m a little more nervous than I was before,” she said. “I had heard about Ebola, but I was sure they wouldn’t send her anywhere that wasn’t safe. I guess if they get it under control, it will be all right.’ It did not help that Rebecca began feeling ill after returning home, or that the hospital placed her in quarantine after learning she had just returned from Liberia. The diagnosis turned out to be strep throat. A key goal of the Peace Corps, formed by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, is to familiarize Americans with the cultures and lifestyles of foreign countries. She was there just six weeks, but Monnier said she gained a quick familiarity with Liberia. Her first impression, after leaving the airport in Monrovia, was Liberia’s Third World nature. “It is hard to describe how little infrastructure there is,” she said. “There aren’t a lot of roads, there aren’t a lot of buildings. The roads look like roads, but there’s no road there, they’re just dirt.” She stayed with a host family, referring to her hosts as Ma and Pa. Ma sold buckets and bowls in a local market, while Pa had a contract job. Their occupations raised their living standards above many Liberian families, she said, though luxuries regarded as minimal in the United States, such as running water and refrigerators are enjoyed only by wealthy people in large cities. Monnier helped carry buckets of water from a nearby well, and encountered cultural oddities such as a chicken running around a kitchen or neighborhood children eager to eat her discarded chicken bones. And an abiding friendliness that survived two decades of civil war that ended in 2003. She said it is common to see nice houses sitting beside mud huts with dirt floors, but that Liberians show no class consciousness. “It doesn’t define them or their friendships,” she said. “Their attitude is, ‘We’re all people, and I maybe don’t have as much as you have, but we’re all in this together. “Liberians have the mentality that if I have something I’m going to do what I can to help my neighbor. If I don’t have anything then I can’t help my neighbor, but if I have something I am going to help my neighbor.” Liberians are very aware of their historical relationship with the United States, she said, Liberia having been founded in the early 19th century by African-American returnees to Africa who named the capital of Monrovia after U.S. President James Monroe. Liberia’s national flag is the stars and stripes, although it displays just one star. “I don’t know if Americans feel the same way, but Liberians definitely feel a close connection,” Monnier said. “They love America, and they love Americans. They see themselves as America’s little sister.” Her students were eager to learn, Monnier said. Their classroom consisted of chairs, desks and a chalkboard, the sophistication of an American classroom being beyond their imagination. But their thirst for learning was real, she said, even for so simple a lesson as a description of the humble barnacle. “They had no idea what a barnacle was, so I explained it to them and they just soaked it all up,” she said. “The next day, when I tested them, the remembered everything.” Monnier said the return of the Peace Corps carries deep meaning for Liberians, who were among the first nations to receive volunteers after the corps’ founding in 1961. It is a sign, she said, that peace has returned to their war-ravaged nation. “It’s a huge symbol that their civil war is over, and normality is returning,” she said.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

From now until the end of the risk of the disease appear, spread over a very large herds, requires proactive prevention of disease. One way to prevent the disease in herds spread, boom. Talking to Mr Nguyen Nhan Lung, the Director of Veterinary province known, to ensure safety for livestock epidemics, the last time Departments regular communication, dissemination, raising measure guide Legal prevention, organized two mass vaccination summer and autumn-winter Xuan, combined vaccination monthly additional vaccines for livestock. At the same time, directing the local deployment phase hygiene, disinfection of the environment, strengthen veterinary hygiene inspection and control of slaughter, transport and trade of livestock and poultry. When outbreaks occur, Sub concentrate forces and means of zoning, enclosure, handling regulations (destruction, vaccination, quarantine, outbreak management ...) fast, efficient so outbreaks of avian influenza, foot and mouth disease of cattle, pig ears are blue in timely control, not spread wide, compared to the same period in 2012, the number of households, villages, communes, districts have the disease out Pets are dropped. Specifically, the number of households have translated only 21% of villages offer by 12.5%, some 16.5% of communes with care, cattle, poultry destroyed by 21% over the same period of 2012. Search understood in Que Vo, local healthy development of animal husbandry, poultry, thanks to the proactive, positive prevention of disease as well as the District Veterinary Station of people so far this year from the herd livestock and poultry are not large outbreak occurred. Our motto is the prevention, vaccination has always been at the forefront district. Family Nguyen The Decision, Nhan Hoa commune regularly raising pigs 100-150. Each year tens of tons of slaughtered hog, bringing considerable income for the family. So the family very seriously and make good veterinary work in farming, especially the diseases vaccinated pigs periodically. According to Nguyen Van Xuyen, Chief Veterinary Station Que Vo, not only his family Decision, in recent years a lot of farmers in the province had such a sense of disease prevention for livestock. This is the motivation for the veterinary staff more accountable basis of the work, from which the organization of vaccination becomes effective, avoid omissions, injection ""sham"". To effectively implement vaccination campaigns, District Veterinary Station was closely coordinated with the CPCs conference for large farms propagation of Veterinary Ordinance, the mandatory vaccination disease, thereby awareness of farmers. At the same time, open the training guide how to preserve social veterinary vaccines, how to identify the sites and conduct proper injection technique. Thus, from the beginning of the year in the district not to major epidemics, livestock, poultry maintain stability and development. Although it has achieved great success in the prevention of disease in livestock, but in the future, especially in the last months, the temperature is low, the resistance of the cattle, poultry weak This is also the time of purchase and sale, transport, slaughter cattle, poultry vibrant place, so the disease is likely to occur, especially haemorrhagic septicemia disease, foot and mouth disease in the herd cattle; cholera, stamped, paratyphoid in pigs; avian influenza in chickens and ducks.

309639,influenza,USA,10/14/2009 19:38,NA,"The health department will direct H1N1 vaccination clinics at the school for children and at-risk groups, beginning the first week in November, Dr. Rick Beesley said. Three separate clinics are planned. The shots will be given free, as part of the government plan, he said. At-risk groups may include teachers, healthcare providers, pregnant women, those caring for infants and those with certain health conditions requiring daily medication. Upcoming vaccinations for the H1N1 flu will be under the purview of the health department and therefore are completely controlled by the government -- which should give everyone confidence, Beesley joked, speaking before a small group of interested community members in the high school auditorium last week. He and infection control nurse Valerie Lambiase gave a shot in the arm to the swine (H1N1) flu and answered questions about the illness. He encouraged those students and people in at-risk groups who may have already had the H1N1 flu to get the immunization when it becomes available. 'You may think you`ve already had it....but it`s okay to be vaccinated,' Beesley said. School nurse Theresa Oja said although the data changes daily, there is a clearly delineated group of those considered at high-risk (teachers being among that group). Based on how much vaccine is provided, the high-risk groups will be inoculated accordingly, Lambiase said. Oja stressed the clinics will not be ones where the patients are lined up and everyone gets vaccinated. Parents have to accompany the children and sign a form. As the priority groups are vaccinated, the rest of the population under 65 may receive inoculations. Those over 65 are not encouraged to get vaccinated. Health care providers are unsure how the vaccine will be distributed and it`s been a confusing issue, they said. Asked whether the disease has peaked and whether it`s that much of an issue, Lambiase said, 'Historically flu outbreaks peak, then hit valleys, then peak again. It`s worth immunizing.' Beesley said, 'Has it gone? Nobody knows. If you can prevent it, it`s worthwhile.' Can you get just a touch of the H1N1 flu? Beesley said usually not, although how it presents itself in different individuals varies. An individual may have just two or three symptoms, while another may have more. How long do germs last on solid surfaces? Lambiase said that varies as well. It`s best to wash your hands often. It`s impossible for anybody to keep surfaces clean all the time, so the best defense is hand-washing, she said. The H1N1 virus only lasts a couple of hours on solid surfaces, Oja said, so no extra disinfecting is necessary. Asked about reported deaths from H1N1, Lambiase said, 'In any given flu season, people are going to pass away from influenza. Beesley said 36,000 people annually die from influenza or its complications. 'That`s an astounding number,' he said. Why do people die from the flu? Some wait too long to get help, some have secondary infections or complications and some people are just too fragile and their bodies can`t stand the stress. 'It could be a combination of all those things, depending on your own immune system,' the health officials said. Asked whether this swine flu resembles the outbreak in the 1970s, officials said it`s a different strain, but similar. Swine flu originally was an outbreak in pigs and the virus mutated to humans. There are no routine tests for H1N1 and testing is usually not recommended. Can it reoccur, once you`ve had it? 'Historically, once something goes through, it`s pretty much gone,' Beesley said. 'But this particular strain is acting a little differently. H1N1 hasn`t read the history books.' So, there could be another wave, within a few weeks, in different age groups. Symptoms include sudden onset, headache, muscle aches, coughing, fever and listlessness, among others. The course may run from three to five days, with the cough persisting for two weeks. The most contagious period is the day before you get sick, Beesley said. Oja said students may go back to school when they feel better and can practice good respiratory hygiene (usually 24 hours after the fever is under control, without medication). Although there is a chance to spread the disease through coughing, the health officials said it`s not practical to keep children out of school for two weeks. When a patient is taking fluids well, responsive, not vomiting, not in respiratory distress. he or she is on the path to recovery. However, a patient should see a doctor if he or she has a severe headache, a stiff neck, is not retaining fluids, is limp as a dishrag, has no energy, the fever is not subsiding or if there is a risk factor such as asthma or diabetes. 'Otherwise, it`s pretty much, yeah, you`re sick, go home and why pay for an office visit?' health officials said. Should Tamiflu be used? The experts are not recommending Tamiflu, unless patients are in the high-risk groups. In addition to a shortage of Tamiflu, patients have built up a resistance to it in the last two years of seasonal flu. 'Viruses are smart. They mutate, become resistant and don`t respond to medication,' Beesley said. For the seasonal flu, local health officials order the immunizations and give the shots, he said. However, for prevention, the best thing may remain hand hygiene and basic things your momma told you. 'Wash your hands before meals and after going to the bathroom,' Lambiase said. 'Get lots of rest, lots of sleep. Eat a balanced diet with fruits and vegetables. Those are some of the best things you can do.' Asked about having hand sanitizers in the classrooms, Oja said, 'We prefer the (elementary) kids wash with soap and water. Hand sanitizers don`t get the 'stuff` off their hands.' A second-grade teacher said she brought her own hand sanitizer to class and she has noticed a decrease in illness. Officials said with 60-percent alcohol as ingredients, sanitizers may be effective. However, it`s possible for children to be sensitive or allergic, so 'we`re pushing soap and water.' Lambiase said the staff at the hospital has been using sanitizers for a long time, with good results. According to statistics, in a typical year, approximately 5 to 20 percent of the population gets the seasonal flu. For more information, see http://flu.gov To plan for a catastrophe, use the following checklist. Store a two-week supply of water and food. During a pandemic, if you cannot get to a store, or if stores are out of supplies, it will be important for you to have extra supplies on hand. This can be useful in other types of emergencies, such as power outages and disasters. Periodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure a continuous supply in your home. Have any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes and vitamins. Talk with family members and loved ones about how they would be cared for if they got sick, or what will be needed to care for them in your home. Volunteer with local groups to prepare and assist with emergency response. Get involved in your community, as it works to prepare for an influenza pandemic. To limit the spread of germs and prevent infection: teach your children to wash hands frequently with soap and water, and model the correct behavior. Teach your children to cover coughs and sneezes with tissues, and be sure to model that behavior. Teach your children to stay away from others as much as possible if they are sick. Stay home from work and school if sick. Items to have on hand for an extended stay at home: Ready-to-eat canned meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, beans, and soups, prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood-pressure monitoring equipment, protein or fruit bars, soap and water or alcohol-based (60-95%) hand wash, dry cereal or granola, medicines for fever, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, peanut butter or nuts, thermometer, dried fruit, anti-diarrheal medication, crackers, vitamins, canned juices, fluids with electrolytes, bottled water, cleansing agent/soap, canned or jarred baby food and formula, flashlight, pet food, batteries, portable radio, manual can opener, garbage bags, tissues, toilet paper and disposable diapers.",NA,NA,0,,,,,,,
3018707,avian influenza,CAN,12/8/2014 3:44,1,"A highly contagious H5N2 strain of the avian bird flu virus has infected at least 140,000 poultry in Canada. Seven countries have now placed restrictions against importing poultry or poultry products from B.C. or Canada. These include the United States, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, South Africa and Mexico. View Full Image REUTERS/Tyrone Siu An health officer packs dead chickens at a wholesale poultry market in Hong Kong January 28, 2014. Hong Kong began culling 20,000 chickens and suspended imports of fresh poultry from mainland China for 21 days on Tuesday after the discovery of the H7N9 bird flu virus in a batch of live chicken from the southern province of Guangdong. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu Officials from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, or CFIA, over the weekend, said a fifth farm in British Columbia's Fraser Valley had been placed under quarantine. All turkeys and chickens from the affected farms will be euthanized, it added. The dreaded H5N2 strain of the avian bird flu virus was first detected a week ago on a broiler-breeder chicken farm in Chilliwack. About 1,000 of the chickens died from the virus. Dr. Harpreet Kochhar, Canada's chief veterinary officer, said they have yet to determine the source of the bird flu virus as the current focus is to contain the spread of infection to other healthy poultry. He suspects, though, the infection could have come from wild or migratory birds. Dr. Jane Pritchard, B.C. chief veterinary officer, confirmed there had been movement of birds between some of the infected five farms. Mike Dungate, executive director of the Chicken Farmers of Canada, quoted by the Globe and Mail, said much of the avian bird flu virus crisis still centers in B.C. Other provinces have yet to feel the impacts of the outbreak in that province. 'People are on - I wouldn't say high alert, but they're on alert,' he said. He also clarified that only poultry from B.C. were banned by the affected countries. About only six or seven percent of Canada's poultry produce gets exported. When it does, half of that goes to the U.S., Taiwan and the Philippines. Of the three, the Philippines has not imposed any restrictions, Dungate said. The CFIA urged poultry farmers to apply strict biosecurity measures on their property so as to protect their flocks. They were also told to immediately report any suspicious symptoms to the CFIA via its website at inspection.gc.ca. Avian influenza viruses do not pose risks to food safety as long as poultry and poultry products are properly handled and cooked. It rarely affects humans that do not have consistent contact with infected birds.

According to Dr. Justin Wane, the Head of the Swine Flu Response Team, the season which started this month gives ample chances for the virus to spread rapidly. ""Since the internal flu outbreak in October last year, 341 cases have been treated and recovered completely. As of Monday, only two had been confirmed in Musanze via our regional sentinel surveillance site. ""Although transmission has been low in the past few weeks, we expect that more cases will be reported considering that the rainy season which favours spread started this month,""� Wane told The New Times. The medical expert warns that the public must remain vigilant as regards the prevention citing that covering of noses and mouths when sneezing and coughing, washing hands regularly and quick medical consultation for suspected cases is vital. Swine Flu was first confirmed in Mexico, early last year. Since then it has spread to the rest of the world. Ministry of Health officials however maintain that there are no severe cases of the flu as confirmed cases recover quickly. ""The rate at which patients are recovering is indeed commendable and there is no need for alarm since this flu is treatable. We have the necessary treatment doses and enough capacity to handle these cases,""� the Health Minister, Dr. Richard Sezibera recently assured.

292149,influenza,USA,9/15/2009 21:27,NA,"Hand-Washing Won’t Stop H1N1 It's become conventional wisdom that simple soap and water can protect against the flu, but the science suggests otherwise. How much do you know about the Ebola virus? Can you identify the bug that causes swine flu? Take our quiz and find out. Swine Flu: Questions and Answers from Harvard Medical School Please fill in the following information and we'll email this link. Separate multiple addresses with commas In a speech to schoolchildren last week that had some conservative opponents up in arms, President Obama delivered at least one line that seemed incontestable: 'I hope you'll all wash your hands a lot, and stay home from school when you don't feel well, so we can keep people from getting the flu this fall and winter.' The Disney corporation is now marketing Musical Hand Wash Timers featuring characters like the Little Mermaid, and encouraging parents to 'take precaution against swine flu' by teaching children to wash their hands correctly. 'Studies prove that regular hand-washing dramatically reduces the spread of infection,' says the Disney Web page, which links to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site. Thanks in part to this and other campaigns run by the CDC , it has become conventional wisdom that hand-washing is the best way to protect yourself from the H1N1 strain of influenza. But while hand-washing has been shown to be a great defense against the common cold and other respiratory diseases, it might not actually be that helpful against the influenza virus, including the H1N1 strain. That's because there is virtually no evidence that people can catch the influenza virus from germs that they pick up on their hands, according to Arthur Reingold, head of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley, and codirector of the CDC-funded California Emerging Infections Program. Instead, humans are most likely to catch influenza by breathing in microscopic particles exhaled by infected people. Reingold and other epidemiologists don't discount hand-washing as an important tool in public health: there is plenty of evidence that it prevents other nasty bugs, including the common cold, many respiratory infections, and viruses that cause diarrhea. But Reingold is bothered by the lack of science supporting the CDC's message, and he worries that the emphasis on a simple measure like hand-washing creates a false sense of security from H1N1 and tamps down the discussion of more difficult preventive measures. He said as much in an e-mail to the CDC this May. 'I wouldn't care so much that we might be getting folks to improve handwashing . . . with what is likely to be incorrect information about its ability to prevent influenza' if the media and the court of public opinion weren't so quick to embrace it as the only solution at the expense of things like surgical masks, wrote Reingold in his letter to the CDC. While Reingold admits he doesn't know if masks would reduce transmission of the virus, he hypothesizes that they're more likely to be helpful containing exposure to the airborne virus than hand-washing, and should not be so easily discounted. (Other experts are skeptical of face masks because it's difficult to ensure proper use, or that people will wear them in the first place.) Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, says the CDC's emphasis on hand-washing is guided by the 'science that supports hand-washing against respiratory infections in general.' In particular, she cites a study conducted in Pakistan that showed that hand hygiene measures cut the rate of pneumonia in half. One of the unique features of swine flu—the fact that it causes diarrhea—also suggests to some that it could be transmitted on the hands like other diarrhea-causing diseases that do not belong to the influenza family. Schuchat stresses that the best way to protect yourself will be to get the vaccine once it becomes available in October, but adds that the CDC continues to believe that 'contact precautions are useful with this flu.' But the ferrets and guinea pigs tell a different story, says Dr. Michael Osterholm, of the National Institutes of Health-supported Minnesota Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance, and head of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. Researchers in the Netherlands used ferrets to study the transmission of H1N1 and found that the disease was efficiently transmitted by small airborne particles. An earlier study examining a different flu strain in guinea pigs found that the animals did not pick up the virus from contaminated cages. That suggests that you're not really safer from the flu virus if you scrub your hands, paws, or cages because the virus travels through the air. While there's not enough evidence to conclusively say the flu works the same way for humans, the current research suggests that the H1N1 flu travels mostly by air, not via hand-to-hand contact—and therefore won't be prevented through hand-washing. 'We don't want to create a crisis in confidence,' Osterholm says, 'but we have to be honest: the evidence doesn't show that hand-washing prevents the spread of the influenza virus.' Nevertheless, hand-washing is still your best defense against getting sick generally this fall—colds and other respiratory diseases are no fun, even if they don't sound as scary as swine flu. For that and other flu viruses, don't seek solutions at the sink: your best chance of avoiding H1N1 this fall is to get the vaccine once it becomes available. It's time to rethink end-of-life care.

This year, the annual marathon held in Montenegro's capital will host a total of 378 professional athletes coming from 35 countries around the world.

While the helpers sacrifice on site, part of the aid has been caught in the bureaucracy. A comment in word and image, a user post by Timo Essner When the first reports of a renewed outbreak of Ebola epidemic in West Africa began circulating in March this year, the reactions were characterized yet varied and activism: it was, the epidemic to be in no sir, before a critical extent of the spread of the disease would require a containment impossible. About six months later, Ebola threatens to win the fight. In mid-October announced the ARD tagesschau that the aid agencies now run out of money for the local assistants in the affected regions. The helpers often go completely inadequately protected from house to house and collect the remains of Ebola victims. In addition to the mental stress of working with corpses and the hostility of the population, the volunteers live with the constant fear of infection.

The number of people has doubled since the beginning of 2014 to six: Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Mali, Senegal, Nigeria. This cartoon I drew already on 06 September - nearly two months ago. It could not have guessed how timeless this drawing is yes. Because it has been part of the WHO now nothing worth mentioning to give relief, while the MSF risk every day in the work with the medieval treatment conditions their lives. Now it is not that our federal government only the WHO had supplied with money. Other organizations, including MSF, receive financial and material assistance. The central question is rather, somewhat exaggerated: How many Americans and Europeans must die of Ebola until the WHO finally responding to the epidemic in Africa? Panic Fortress Europe during the epidemic in Africa rages, the rich countries in Europe and America seal off increasingly. First Contagion cases on home soil displaced the US literally overnight in a headless media hysteria with the usual reaktioären panic patterns: some are now calling for travel bans for blacks, others suspect the risk of infection by illegal immigrants from Mexico. In Europe, it stops responding less helpless: suspected and actual cases in Germany, France, Spain and Denmark inevitably led to heckle the immigration opponents and quickly became a factual question on protective measures against an epidemic a meaningless discussion about poverty refugees as disease carriers. I would like to say at this point: Ebola raging in West Africa, but most poverty refugees from Africa come from the east and center of the continent. Apart from the fact that thousands of miles between them lie, it only create strong, healthy people to survive the rigors of this often weeklong odyssey. In addition, these people would be affected regions logically rather avoid in order not to unnecessarily expose a risk of infection. Import of infection is much more probable transmission in this country as recently happened in Spain and previously in the United States: In the United States the staff was inadequately prepared for the worst and were negligent in dealing with the quarantine patients. In Spain, the infection of a nurse attending was simply a logical consequence of a systematic imbalance. For our European partner country was 2008 such a drastic renovations forced in the wake of the financial crisis, the health sector was similar to the labor market completely zonked. The hospitals in Spain to some extent, to emergency power. Many special departments were closed devices sold in some regions and the entire clinic was shut equal - which is of course an additional burden on the remaining houses carries with it. So the Spaniards could only isolate their Ebola patients - and treat with aspirin. Since even the layman fight stunned the hair. Now you might be noted in passing that it does not seem particularly useful to import in the form of Ebola infected normal. They are well equipped specialized departments for tropical diseases are few and far between in this country. But this only in passing. Measures do not replace Fundamentals decisive for successful control of an epidemic are three factors: an enlightened population, timely consistent quarantine of suspected cases and an efficient health care system. I see Germany for at least two points sensitive weaknesses. The information available to the general public can not be better than that of their politicians and experts. Thus, if the decision makers do not agree on what to choose, uncertainty is spreading. This can be impressively seen in the headlines for a few weeks. That we are now approaching us in Germany the sad Spanish standard for hospitals, will result in doubt about similar issues. Think globally, act locally This results in two urgent consequences: First, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa ahead and already active helpers support locally with cash and cash benefits. Secondly counteract the decline of quality power supply in European hospitals quickly and sustainably. This is significantly crucial that you degrade the bureaucracy in health care, where they constitute a barrier - for the benefit of timely assistance and reimbursement in case of illness. Only with a solid, reliable basic structure in the health sector, we will continue to be able to protect ourselves and to help others.",NA,de,0,,,,,,,

But AFP public affairs head Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc said the peacekeepers will still have to be quarantined upon return to the Philippines this coming Tuesday, Nov. 11. In a post on his Twitter account, Cabunoc said the 108 peacekeepers underwent the test Nov. 8, Saturday. 'The Ebola screening test is a requirement by the UN mission in Liberia before repatriating the peacekeepers back to their home country,' he said. On the other hand, he said that while the peacekeepers passed the test in Liberia, they will still undergo a 21-day quarantine upon return to the Philippines.

Bobby Jindal said Wednesday. The closing is a precaution because one of the ailing sixth-graders was recently in Mexico, where experts say the swine flu outbreak may have started, Jindal said. Doctors did a quick test to see whether the students have one of two broad types of flu. It was Type A, which includes swine flu. If a more detailed state test cannot rule out swine flu, the samples will go to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The state test takes 6 hours, and it probably would take 24 to 48 hours to get results from any CDC tests, said Jolie Adams, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Hospitals. 'This can increase based on volume, but ... everything is being done to do this as quickly as possible,' she wrote in an e-mail. The students are among about 800 at Cathedral Carmel, a Roman Catholic school which teaches kindergarten through eighth grade. Jindal says it will be closed Thursday and Friday. If it is swine flu, 'we've got an epidemiological plan in place, as does the CDC,' Jindal said. Officials stressed that the specific flu strain is not yet known. 'What sets this apart is that we know that one of the children had been in Mexico,' Alan Levine, secretary of the state Department of Health and Hospitals, said during an afternoon news conference with Jindal. Coincidentally, Jindal said, a group of studnets from Cathedral Carmel visited the Capitol on Wednesday and met with the governor and some legislators. The announcement came as Louisiana was adding to its stockpile of antiviral drugs in case of an epidemic. By the end of the week it will have enough to treat more than 690,000 people. Adams said Louisiana has enough antiviral drugs to treat 464,803 adults and 64,165 children, and is getting enough for another 167,250 people from the federal stockpile. The state stockpile is in addition to supplies available through private doctors and pharmacies.

'The only way to protect us in the U.S. is to stop it at the source, and to build systems both in Africa and the U.S. that will find, stop and prevent Ebola,' said Frieden, likening the spread of Ebola virus to a wild fire. If secured, the funding will be spent in part on increased foreign aid to halt the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Another portion of the money could build new safeguards to help American hospitals respond swiftly to potential future outbreaks.

2867466,ebola,LBR,10/15/2014 14:51,0,"A total of 8997 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in seven affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain, and the United States of America) up to the end of 12 October. There have been 4493 deaths. Data for epidemiological week 41 are incomplete, with missing data for 12 October from Liberia. This reflects the challenging nature of data gathering in countries with widespread and intense EVD transmission. These challenges remain particularly acute in Liberia, where there continues to be a mismatch between the relatively low numbers of new cases reported through official clinical surveillance systems on one hand, and reports from laboratory staff and first responders of large numbers of new cases on the other. Efforts are ongoing to reconcile different sources of data, and to rapidly scale-up capacity for epidemiological data gathering throughout each country with widespread and intense transmission. It is clear, however, that the situation in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is deteriorating, with widespread and persistent transmission of EVD. An increase in new cases in Guinea is being driven by a spike in confirmed and suspected cases in the capital, Conakry, and the nearby district of Coyah. In Liberia, problems with data gathering make it hard to draw any firm conclusions from recent data. There is almost certainly significant under-reporting of cases from the capital Monrovia. There does appear to have been a genuine fall in the number of cases in Lofa district, but a concerted effort will be required to sustain that drop in cases and translate it into an elimination of EVD in that area. In Sierra Leone, intense transmission is still occurring in the capital Freetown and the surrounding districts. Of the countries with localized transmission, Nigeria and Senegal are now approaching 42 days since the date of last potential contact with a probable or confirmed case. Both Spain and the United States continue to monitor potential contacts. In response to the unprecedented EVD epidemic, the first-ever UN emergency health mission, the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER1 ) has been set up. Its strategic priorities are to stop the spread of the disease, treat infected patients, ensure essential services, preserve stability and prevent the spread to countries currently unaffected by EVD. WHO will continue to be responsible for overall health strategy and advice within the Mission, and has now moved its base of operations from Conakry, Guinea, to the UNMEER Mission headquarters in Accra, Ghana. A four-day crisis management and operational planning meeting will take place in Accra from 15 October. OUTLINE This is the eighth in a series of regular situation reports on the Ebola Response Roadmap2 . The report contains a review of the epidemiological situation based on official information reported by ministries of health, and an assessment of the response measured against the core Roadmap indicators where available. The data contained in this report are the best available. Because of widespread under-reporting of confirmed cases in Liberia, suspected cases are now also shown in country histograms. Substantial efforts are ongoing to improve the availability and accuracy of information about both the epidemiological situation and the implementation of response measures. Following the roadmap structure, country reports fall into three categories: (1) those with widespread and intense transmission (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone); (2) those with an initial case or cases, or with localized transmission (Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, and the United States of America); and (3), those countries that neighbour areas of active transmission (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Senegal). An overview of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there is a separate, unrelated outbreak of EVD, is also provided (see Annex 2). 1. COUNTRIES WITH WIDESPREAD AND INTENSE TRANSMISSION The upward epidemic trend continues in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. 8973 probable, confirmed, and suspected cases of EVD and 4484 deaths have been reported up to the end of 12 October 2014 by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone, and up to the end of 11 October by the Ministry of Health of Liberia (table 1). GUINEA There is evidence of an increase in the intensity of transmission in Guinea. Compared with the previous week, a very slight drop in the number of new confirmed cases reported from the capital Conakry (figure 1) has been more than offset by a sharp rise in the number of new cases in the neighbouring district of Coyah, with 25 cases reported between 6 and 12 October. Because laboratory data is currently well integrated with clinical surveillance in Guinea, many of the newly reported suspected cases are likely to be reclassified or discarded in the coming weeks. N’Zerekore (29 cases) and Kerouane (14 cases) have also shown a marked increase in new cases in recent weeks. Transmission remains intense in Macenta, which reported 51 new cases between 6 and 12 October. Gueckedou, where the outbreak originated, reported one suspected case during the same period. In the east of the country, on the border with Côte d’Ivoire, the districts of Beyla and Lola both reported new cases (figure 4), emphasizing the need for active surveillance at local border crossings. To the North, the district of Boke, on the border with Guinea-Bissau has reported active transmission for the first time in more than 21 days. The central district of Mamou has reported a confirmed case for the first time. LIBERIA Data acquisition continues to be a challenge in Liberia. Evidence obtained from responders and laboratory staff in the country suggests that the situation in Liberia is getting worse, and that transmission remains intense in the capital, Monrovia. As has been the case over the past four weeks, very few confirmed cases were reported from Monrovia between 6 and 11 October (figure 2), reflecting ongoing delays in matching laboratory results with clinical surveillance data. By contrast, 138 suspected and probable cases were reported from Monrovia during the same period, many of which are likely to be genuine cases of EVD. Outside Monrovia, most newly reported cases have come from the districts of Bong (75 cases) and Margibi (28 cases). The recent fall in the number of new cases reported from Lofa, which borders Gueckedou in Guinea, appears to have continued, with reports from observers in the area suggesting that there is evidence of a genuine decline. It should be noted, however, that the 13 new cases that were reported in Lofa between 6 and 11 October represents a high number in the context of an EVD outbreak, and a concerted effort will be required to halt all transmission in the area. SIERRA LEONE EVD transmission is rampant in Sierra Leone, with 425 new confirmed cases reported between 6 and 12 October (figure 3). The areas hardest hit are the capital, Freetown, with 172 new cases, along with the neighbouring western districts of Bombali (94 cases) and Port Loko (67 cases). The central districts of Bo (22 new cases), and Tonkolili (27 new cases) are also areas of intense transmission. Transmission appeared to have been slowing in recent weeks in Kailahun and Kenema. However, this week has seen an increase in new cases, with eight new cases in Kailahun and 16 in Kenema.HEALTH-CARE WORKERS 427 health-care workers (HCWs) are known to have been infected with EVD up to the end of 12 October. 236 HCWs have died (table 2). WHO is undertaking extensive investigations to determine the cause of infection in each case. Early indications are that a substantial proportion of infections occurred outside the context of Ebola treatment and care. Infection prevention and control quality assurance checks are now underway at every ebola treatment unit in the three intense-transmission countries. At the same time, exhaustive efforts are ongoing to ensure an ample supply of optimal personal protective equipment to all Ebola treatment facilities, along with the provision of training and relevant guidelines to ensure that all HCWs are exposed to the minimum possible level of risk. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION AND NEWLY AFECTED DISTRICTS Figure 4 shows the location of cases throughout the countries with widespread and intense transmission. In Guinea, the northern district of Boke, on the border with Guinea-Bissau, has reported active transmission for the first time in more than 21 days. The central district of Mamou has reported one confirmed for the first time. RESPONSE IN COUNTRIES WITH WIDESPREAD AND INTENSE TRANSMISSION The first-ever UN emergency health mission, the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) has been set up to address the unprecedented EVD epidemic. The strategic priorities of the Mission are be to stop the spread of the disease, treat infected patients, ensure essential services, preserve stability, and prevent the spread of EVD to countries currently unaffected by EVD. WHO will continue to be responsible for overall health strategy and advice within the Mission, and has now moved its base of operations from Conakry, Guinea, to the UNMEER Mission headquarters in Accra, Ghana. Following the creation of UNMEER, a comprehensive 90-day plan to control and reverse the epidemic of EVD in West Africa has been put into action. To rapidly reverse the current crisis, capacity will be put in place to isolate at least 70% of EVD cases and safely bury at least 70% of patients who die from EVD by 1 December 2014 (the 60-day target). The ultimate goal is to have capacity in place for the isolation of 100% of EVD cases and the safe burial of 100% of patients who die from EVD by 1 January 2015 (the 90-day target), which is projected to result in a declining rate of transmission in an estimated 85% of affected areas. In accordance with the WHO Ebola Response Roadmap, the 90-day Ebola Response plan requires that at least 50% of major inputs in five crucial domains be put in place by 1 November, with 100% of inputs in place by 1 December. Progress towards putting these inputs in place and the attainment of each target will be assessed through a comprehensive response-monitoring system, and will be reported in due course. The latest key developments in each domain are detailed below. Case management Meetings were held this week and last in Geneva to further refine WHO's existing guidance on personal protective equipment in EVD outbreaks with a formal WHO Guidelines Development Group, including experts from a wide range of partners. A final document is expected within the week. A standing Training Coordination Partners Group met for its third and fourth calls on 8 and 15 October. Efforts to scale-up the number of available EVD-specific beds have been intensified in countries with widespread and persistent transmission. Finding donors to fund the construction of new treatment facilities, and foreign medical teams to staff them, remains an ongoing challenge. Two of four planned ETUs are now fully operation in Guinea (table 3). In Liberia, however, only six of a planned 28 ETUs are currently operational, providing 620 (21%) of 2930 planned beds (figure 6). Health-care partners able to staff and manage ETUs are yet to be found for 16 of 28 planned facilities in the country, contributing to a current shortfall of 2310 beds. In Sierra Leone, almost half of the 18 planned ETUs are now operational. Three facilities accounting for 250 beds require further support before being brought into use. In all three intense-transmission countries, a lack of available beds in ETUs forces many families to care for patients at home. In the home setting, carers are unable to adequately protect themselves from EVD exposure, and thus the risk of transmission within the family and throughout the community is greatly increased. As a remedial measure, Ebola Community Care Units (ECUs)/Community Care Centres (CCCs) are now being introduced into communities. These facilities will enable newly detected cases to be isolated, and thus reduce household transmission. ECUs/CCCs are controlled environments within communities where patients with EVD can receive supportive and palliative care in close proximity to their families. Liberia and Sierra Leone are the first countries to implement ECUs/CCCs. Liberia has opened two CCCs in Bong and Montserrado. In Sierra Leone, a total of 149 CCCs are planned within the next 10 weeks. Case confirmation The total number of operational laboratories in the three intense-transmission countries will increase to 13 in the coming weeks, as a Russian Mobile Laboratory becomes operational in Macenta, Guinea, and a Public Health England laboratory begins to provide diagnostic testing in the Western Rural area of Sierra Leone.

Contact-tracing teams in areas of intense transmission are often overwhelmed by the high volumes of daily contacts to be traced. Logistical difficulties, community denial of the existence of EVD, and community resistance can also hamper the ability of teams to trace contacts effectively.

COUNTRIES WITH AN INITIAL CASE OR CASES, OR WITH LOCALIZED TRANSMISSION Four countries, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, and the United States of America have now reported a case or cases imported from a country with widespread and intense transmission. In Nigeria, there have been 20 cases and eight deaths (table 4). In Senegal, there has been one case, but as yet there have been no deaths or further suspected cases attributable to EVD. In the United States of America there have been two cases and one death. In Spain there has been one case. In Nigeria, all 891 contacts have now completed 21-day follow-up (362 contacts in Lagos, 529 contacts in Port Harcourt). A second EVD-negative sample was obtained from the last confirmed case on 8 September (37 days ago). In Senegal, all contacts have now completed 21-day follow-up, with no further cases of EVD reported. A second EVD-negative sample was obtained from the single confirmed case in Senegal on 5 September (40 days ago). Within a country, an outbreak of EVD is considered to be over when 42 days (double the 21-day incubation period of the Ebola virus) has elapsed since the last patient in isolation became laboratory negative for EVD4 . In Spain, 72 people, including 13 high-risk contacts, are being monitored. In the United States of America, 125 contacts are being monitored. 3. PREPAREDNESS OF COUNTRIES TO RAPIDLY DETECT AND RESPOND TO AN EBOLA EXPOSURE In accordance with the UNMEER 90-day plan, strengthening the preparedness of all countries to respond to an initial exposure to EVD is a mission-critical priority. Accordingly, all countries should have a protocol for suspect cases, an equipped isolation unit, a minimum stock of personal protective equipment, a case-management team trained in infection prevention and control, and a public communications strategy. All countries bordering affected areas should have active surveillance in, and weekly reporting from, areas assessed as at the highest risk of an initial exposure. Countries will be supported with appropriate technical guidance, simulation and protocol testing, and, in case of the importation of an EVD case, a rapid response capacity. On 10 October, a meeting between WHO and partner organizations in Brazzaville agreed on a range of tools to support countries unaffected by Ebola in strengthening their preparedness in the event of an outbreak. One of these tools is a comprehensive checklist of core principles, standards, capacities and practices, which all countries should have or meet. On 13 October, WHO Director General Margaret Chan urged East Asian and Pacific countries to strengthen defenses against EVD. Preparations are ongoing for the third meeting of the IHR emergency committee, which will have a special focus on entry and exit screening5 . ANNEX 1. CATEGORIES USED TO CLASSIFY EBOLA CASES Ebola cases are classified as suspected, probable, or confirmed depending on whether they meet certain criteria (table 5).ANNEX 2. EBOLA OUTBREAK IN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO As at 9 October 2014, and following a retrospective laboratory review of cases, there have been 68 cases (38 confirmed, 28 probable, 2 suspected) of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including eight among health-care workers (HCWs). In total, 49 deaths have been reported, including eight among HCWs. 852 contacts have now completed 21-day follow-up. Of 269 contacts currently being monitored, all (100%) were seen on 9 October, the last date for which data has been reported. This outbreak is unrelated to that affecting Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. ANNEX 3.

2748341,influenza,AUS,9/4/2014 9:01,3,"THE State’s hospitals are under siege as the worst flu epidemic since the swine flu pandemic of 2009 clogs Emergency Departments. Almost 5000 cases have been reported this season compared to less than 2000 in the same period last year — and with a spike in the past week officials say the worst may be yet to come. Health Minister Jack Snelling said the SA Health figures explained why the state’s hospitals had been at capacity. “In the last three weeks we have had more than 50 per cent of all flu cases this year,” Mr Snelling said. “Last season there was a late peak and this carried over to summer. The same situation could occur this summer. “Flu season has not only hit harder but it also hit later. Just this week, 1074 cases of influenza were reported.” Mr Snelling urged the public to get flu shots, saying it was not too late in the year. In the swine flu pandemic 9679 cases were officially recorded by tests. Flu cases have helped pushed EDs in major hospitals well beyond capacity on a regular basis for the past few weeks. Adding to the problem is a spike in the gastro-causing rotavirus, which has gone from 171 cases this time last year to 527, and salmonella which has jumped from 157 to 819. The situation has reached a point the Royal Adelaide Hospital has in recent weeks started “ramping” for the first time, where ambulances are forced to wait in the car park with paramedics treating non-urgent cases until space becomes available. A snapshot of major hospitals yesterday (THURS) at 3.30pm showed all had significantly more people being treated in their Emergency Departments than their capacity, plus more waiting. For example, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital with an ED capacity of 31 had 50 people being treated, eight waiting and two expected by ambulance. Average waiting time at the QEH was more than an hour and five people had been waiting for a bed for more than 24 hours. SA Health chief public health officer Dr Stephen Christley said flu was difficult to predict. “This has taken me by surprise, we put out more vaccine than in previous years and really don’t know why the numbers have skyrocketed in the past three weeks,” he said. “It is not a different flu. People should use good hygiene and remember it is not too late to get vaccinated.” Opposition treasury spokesman Rob Lucas warned of more bottlenecks. “Adelaide’s major hospitals have been stretched to breaking point during the past week, with patients in EDs subjected to huge waiting times as the system struggles to cope,” he said. “It is more than two years since the State Labor Government promised the implementation of the Monaghan Review would end ramping at FMC and now the problem has spread to the RAH and the QEH while remaining entrenched at FMC.”",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2915988,ebola,USA,10/30/2014 11:59,0,"The city is actively monitoring nearly 120 people who have recently returned from Ebola-stricken countries out of an abundance of caution as it seeks to prevent the spread of the deadly virus, Mayor de Blasio's administration said Thursday. Marti Adams, first deputy press secretary for the administration, said most of the 117 people being monitored arrived in New York City from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia Oct. 11 or later. Active monitoring means state or local health officials establish regular communication with the individuals, rather than relying on them to self-monitor and report potential symptoms. The list of people being monitored includes members of the staff at Bellevue Hospital Center who are caring for Craig Spencer, New York City's first and only confirmed case of Ebola. Spencer tested positive for Ebola last week after developing a fever nearly two weeks after he returned to his Harlem home following a Doctors Without Borders stint treating patients in Guinea. The emergency personnel who transported Spencer to the hospital and the lab workers who handled Spencer's blood are being monitored ,along with Spencer's fiancee and two friends who had close contact with him in the days before he got sick. None have shown symptoms to this point. Adams said the number of people being monitored is subject to change on a daily basis as more travelers from the countries affected by Ebola arrive in the city, as travelers leave the city and as the 21-day incubation period ends for people already being monitored. Meanwhile, the city's Ebola response is expected to cost 'many millions' of dollars, the mayor's office said earlier this week. The Office of Management and Budget is gathering the financial details to date and computing future expenditures as it works to develop a full accounting of the costs of Ebola preparation and treatment. But the anticipation is that the costs 'will be significant,' Adams said. She added that the city would seek federal assistance. Several sick patients have been taken to local hospitals over the last few weeks with fevers or flu-like symptoms, though not all have been tested for Ebola. A 5-year-old Bronx boy was tested for the deadly virus after falling ill Sunday night following a trip to West Africa, but authorities said Tuesday he had a respiratory infection and would be removed from an isolation room. Ebola has early symptoms in common with diseases like malaria, salmonella, cholera and the flu, and though the chances of the average New Yorker contracting the virus are slim, health officials are conducting tests in select situations out of an abundance of caution to ensure no outbreak.

2350864,ebola,GIN,3/23/2014 14:35,NA,"CONAKRY: An Ebola epidemic which has already killed dozens of people in Guinea's southern forests has spread to the capital Conakry, the United Nations Children's Fund said on Sunday. 'At least 59 out of 80 who contracted Ebola across the West African country have died so far. Over the past few days, the deadly haemorrhagic fever has quickly spread from the communities of Macenta, Gueckedou, and Kissidougou to the capital, Conakry,' UNICEF said in a statement emailed to AFP. Conakry, a vast, sprawling port city on Guinea's Atlantic coast, is estimated to have a population of between 1.5 and two million. To date, no treatment or vaccine is available for Ebola, which kills between 25 and 90 percent of those who fall sick, depending on the strain of the virus, according to the World Health Organisation. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with blood, faeces or sweat, or by sexual contact or unprotected handling of contaminated corpses. UNICEF said at least three victims of the outbreak, which began on February 9, were children. 'This outbreak is particularly devastating because medical staff are among the first victims, so far it has killed at least eight health workers who have been in contact with infected patients, hindering the response and threatening normal care in a country already lacking in medical personnel,' UNICEF said. The organisation said it had rushed five tonnes of aid, including medical supplies, to the most affected areas in Guinea's south. 'In Guinea, a country with a weak medical infrastructure, an outbreak like this can be devastating,' said the organisation's Guinea representative, Mohamed Ag Ayoya. 'UNICEF has pre-positioned supplies and stepped up communication on the ground to inform and sensitise medical staff and the population on how to avoid contracting Ebola.' The organisation urged Guineans not to attend funerals wherever possible and to avoid all contact with the sick and the dead. Ebola, one of the world's most virulent diseases, was first discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1976 and the country has had eight outbreaks. The most recent epidemic, also in the DRC, infected 62 people and left 34 dead between May and November 2012, according to the country's health ministry. There are fears it could be used in a biological weapons attack. According to researchers, the virus multiplies quickly, overwhelming the immune system's ability to fight the infection. Medical aid group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said in a statement on Saturday it had set up isolation units for suspected cases in the southern region of Nzerekore and was seeking out people who may have had contacts with the infected.

2838815,ebola,LBR,10/7/2014 7:03,0,"The French charity Medecins Sans Frontiers or Doctors Without Borders continues to render assistance to the Government of Liberia in the fight against the deadly Ebola outbreak here. The Ebola outbreak, which started from neighboring Guinea early March, has passed serious challenge to the health sector of Liberia, taking away the lives of health care workers, nurses and Medical Doctors, including ordinary citizens. MSF Emergency Coordinator Laurence Sailly, told a regular news briefing Monday at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Monrovia that the agency is a medical humanitarian organization working in more than 60 countries across the world, adding that the main function is to provide relief after and during natural disasters such as flood or earthquake in any country. Ms Sailly said MSF helps victims of conflict, including the running of an emergency feeding program during nutritional crisis as well as respond to neglected diseases such as Malaria, HIV and Aids, including Tuberculosis, among others by preventing them from spreading. According to her, since MSF took over the Ebola Treatment Unit at ELWA 3, its staff has done lot of good work: 'MSF has trained 400 community health volunteers to go door-to-door across Monrovia to share messages on how best to prevent Ebola and what to do if a person becomes sick.' The ELWA3 Ebola Management Centre has 250 beds with 1,052 patients cared for by MSF, 740 of them confirmed Ebola cases with 236 survivors, statistics released by the charity said. She said more than 3,200 people are working with MSF across West Africa, trying to contain the Ebola outbreak, including over 1,375 persons in Monrovia and Lofa County in Liberia. Ms Sailly noted that MSF's priority is to provide patients the best chance of surviving, adding that in order for patients to survive the virus, it had conducted series of consultation with patients at the triage to evaluate if their symptoms are Ebola-related or not. She said two important steps should be taken for patients, including medication to help reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and then to make sure enough fluids administered to keep them hydrated to avoid going into shock.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2437963,measles,VNM,4/29/2014 10:59,0,"The Health Ministry confirmed two more measles deaths in Hanoi last Friday raising this year's fatalities to 133. The two infants succumbed to the virus at the Bach Mai and Central Pediatrics Hospital during a citywide tour of health facilities by Health Minister Nguyen Thi Kim Tien, which included the Hanoi Tropical Diseases Hospital, Tuoi Tre newspaper reported. Ho Thi Bich, a nurse employed at the pediatric hospital which reported 110 measles deaths this year said Tien has gotten to witness the painful situation. “After more than four years working at the hospital, this is the first time I’ve seen so many deaths from a single outbreak,” Bich said who is five months pregnant. She said many of the fatal cases are twins and the hospital usually can only save one of them. “I remember the recent twins An Phong and An Phu. They were so adorable and chubby' now one’s gone.” The intensive care unit at Bach Mai Hospital, which has lost seven children, is usually full of sobs and prayers. Pham Thi Bich anxiously observes the treatment of her 4-month-old son; she just finished burying his twin sister, who died of measles here. The mother said her daughter and many other children succumbed soon after they were put on respirators, so she's been a wreck ever since her son was put on one. During a recent conference, doctors from all over the country attributed the fatalities and severe cases from this year's measles outbreak to the virus' virulent attacks on its victims lungs. In previous years, the virus had mostly caused cerebral swelling and fever. Though the virus has always been dangerous to infants, compromising a child's respiratory system has proven far more fatal. As she shed uncontrollable tears, Bich recalled how doctors had said her boy had shown signs of recovery in the past two days and she hoped that would mean a higher chance of survival than his sister. “My husband and I sought treatment everywhere,' she said. 'It took seven years to conceive two of them, and now one’s gone.” Lying alongside her son was a 9-month-old boy from nearby Bac Ninh Province. His skin rash-addled skin has been shedding in large swathes, and his mother is inconsolable most of the time, leaving his grandmother to care for him. Southern outbreaks Meanwhile, Ho Chi Minh City's Health authorities have reported the return of chickenpox and hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) with more infections year-on-year. Nguyen Huu Hung, deputy director of the city health department, told Tuoi Tre the nation has entered peak time for HFMD outbreaks. In the meantime, the city has run out of the chickenpox vaccine amid a new outbreak. Figures from the Health Ministry showed that the city's HFMD infections has increased 28.9 percent year-on-year to nearly 2,700. Nearby Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province has reported more than 1,100 HFMD cases this year, up 34.4 percent over the same period last year. To Duc Sinh, director of the Preventive Health Center of Binh Phuoc Province said that infections have increased to more than 30 a week, or 174 cases this year--most were reported in late March. Khanh Hoa Province on the central coast also reported an uptick in HFMD infections. The province’s Preventive Health Center said 284 HFMD cases have been noted this year, most were children.  HFMD killed at least 41 out of more than 110,000 cases in 2012 and 169 the year before out of roughly the same number of infections. All of the reported fatalities were children.  No vaccination is currently available for the disease, which causes blisters on the victims hands and feet and sores in their mouth. Treatment requires the use of respirators and blood dialysis. Infections occur most commonly in children under five; many of the fatalities were caused by EV71, the most virulent strain of the Entovirus and also the most common in Vietnam.

2708645,ebola,LBR,8/20/2014 19:25,NA,"In Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, the West Point slum sits on a peninsula that is slowly eroding into the ocean. There are four toilets here to service the approximately 75,000 inhabitants. It is an area where diseases stemming from poor sanitation and lack of running water are common, and it is now the hotspot for one of Monrovia’s worst Ebola disasters. On the August 16, anger outside of West Point’s makeshift Ebola isolation center became overwhelming. Residents swarmed the clinic, shouting that Ebola was not real, and simply a government conspiracy to embezzle money. They set up improvised ladders and encouraged and helped Ebola patients escape, before going on to loot the isolation ward. In all, 17 of those suspected of carrying Ebola made their way out of the clinic and into the overpopulated slums. Some made off with items from the ward, including infected mattresses and blood-stained bed sheets. Although it may seem incomprehensible to those of us who live in the West, the reality of temporary isolation wards, juxtaposed with misinformation about the disease, makes situations like these inescapable. The wards are often bare cement rooms, full of patients who are in various states of disrepair. Buckets are often provided near beds, but for the most part, nursing staff is sparse. When a group of journalists were taken on a tour through one of these wards, an Ebola patient called out, “I have been here one week…your bring us food.” Other reports indicate that jobs that should be performed by medical staff have been carried out by families, who are determined to see their loved ones receive adequate care. Understaffing and fear in the medical community means the changing of sheets, washing of clothes, bathing of the patient and feeding have been relegated to those willing to brave Ebola centers for their husbands, wives and children. This, of course, puts further community members at risk, as each exposure to isolation wards means more infections to come. It is in the midst of this chaos and confusion that those who actually are reaching out for medical care have not been helped. One woman, named Konah, described what happened when her husband fell ill, “My husband called, I called, his brothers called, aunties, we all called on different numbers, but nobody has been able to come so when the sickness got serious, we have to leave him in the room and he has been crying there, but since 5 am this morning no sound, so I do not know what is happening to him.” Her husband’s death was later confirmed to be from Ebola. Reports of bodies being left in the streets of West Point and nearby neighborhoods for days are also becoming common. Of course, the viral load for someone who has just died from Ebola is immense and this is one of the most contagious times, but no groups have been around to clean up the bodies. It’s this instability and inability to control West Point that led the government to shut down and quarantine the entire slum. Soldiers and medical personnel were able to enter and retrieve a number of items, such as mattresses and a generator which were stolen from the isolation ward. The President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, justified the quarantine by saying “We have been unable to control the spread due to continued denials, cultural burying practices, disregard for the advice of health workers and disrespect for the warnings by the government.” Although many of those who escaped were rounded up and put into new isolation wards, it is hard for health experts to say who might have been exposed to the virus in the time that contaminated items and Ebola victims were free within the community. Liberia has had the highest number of deaths from Ebola despite the disease originating in Guinea. After coming off of decades of civil war, since 2005, Liberia had begun to stabilize. But this fragile new peace looks to be wavering considerably as the death toll rises. ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
900501,measles,KEN,10/7/2011 7:07,NA,"In 2011 several large measles outbreaks have been reported from member states in the European and African regions, with several reported outbreaks in the Americas linked to Europe or Africa. Europe: According to case-based and aggregated routine surveillance reporting, and outbreak reports provided to the European Regional Office, as of 20 September 2011, 40 of 53 Member States reported 26 025 confirmed measles cases from January to July 2011. The highest number of cases was reported from France with 14 025 for the first six months of the year. In addition, eleven of these cases were lethal (6 in France and one in each of Germany, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom). The predominant genotype currently circulating in the European Region is D4, the same endemic genotype from the United Kingdom in 2008. The most recent outbreak was reported from Israel in September, with 12 cases. Member states have responded to the outbreak by modifying the vaccination schedule, with France adopting a two-dose schedule, by offering vaccination free of charge, or by offering vaccinations in schools. Africa: The Regional Office reports that as of September 2011 large measles outbreaks are occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with over 103 000 cases, Nigeria (17 428 cases), Zambia (6295 cases), Ethiopia, (1408 cases) and Kenya (1995 cases). Even though deaths are not routinely reported to the Regional Office, the WHO Country Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reports over 1100 measles-associated deaths in the country during 2011. Americas: The last case of endemic measles was reported from the region in 2002. In 2011 the Region has received reports of several outbreaks linked to importation of measles virus from other regions. The largest, in Quebec, Canada, involves 742 reported cases, 89 requiring hospitalization, but no measles-associated deaths. Other outbreaks have been reported from the United States (213 cases), Ecuador (41 cases), Brazil (18 cases), Colombia (7 cases), Mexico (3 cases), and Chile (6 cases). Most of these outbreaks are linked to importations from Europe, except for outbreaks in the United States and Chile linked to cases from Malaysia and the outbreak in Ecuador, linked to Kenya. Measles is a highly infectious disease that causes complications and deaths, even in previously-healthy individuals, but is fully preventable by vaccination. Countries need to ensure that they reach 95% coverage with two doses of measles vaccine across all age groups up to 15 years of age. Otherwise the country will experience measles outbreaks with large numbers of cases, associated hospitalizations and deaths. The recent outbreaks in countries with high volumes of international travellers can lead to measles exportation to regions previously free of measles, such as the Region of the Americas or certain African countries. These exportations can lead to large outbreaks and associated deaths. These outbreaks should remind travellers that they should ensure that they have had two doses of measles-containing vaccine before their trip.",NA,NA,0,,,,,,,

1592107,influenza,AUS,3/18/2013 9:53,3,"Swine flu virus may be now resistant to key medicine Tamiflu, raising fears a new outbreak may be difficult to fight, Australian research has warned. While just 2 per cent of swine flu (H1N1) strains around the world are resistant to Tamiflu, the Australian research found mutations in all strains of the swine flu that suggest they might be prone to develop resistance. Researchers found that one in five cases of swine flu in one area of Australia in 2011 were resistant to the antiviral medicine. Dr Aeron Hurt from the World Health Organisation collaborating centre for flu research in Melbourne, said the bug appears more prone than other types of flu to developing drug resistance, The Australian reported. Tamiflu resistance develops when an individual under treatment receives the drug to control their symptoms. In most flu viruses, the changes that make the virus resistant to treatment also make it less likely to spread to others. With swine flu, this has not happened and the virus remains fit enough to spread to others, Hurt said. Research on patients in Newcastle, New South Wales in 2011 found just one person in the area had used Tamiflu but the resistant form of the virus spread to 20 per cent of all those who developed swine flu in that region, News Limited Network reported. 'Widespread transmission of a fit resistant strain is of significant public health concern,' Hurt will tell a conference in Canberra tomorrow. The only way to combat the growth of drug resistant strain of the virus is to save medicines for the most needy cases, he said. ... contd.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
810991,yellow fever,KEN,8/7/2011 7:37,NA,"The new 2011 WHO report indicates that in East Africa, only Tanzania and part of Kenya from Nairobi to the coast are classified as low risk zones to the disease. But the whole of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi remain high-risk areas. Previously, the entire east and southern Africa were classified as Yellow Fever endemic and WHO recommended vaccination for all travellers aged nine months or older. According to the new re-classification, travellers to and from these low risk areas will not require to produce proof of vaccination unless travellers’ itineraries indicate potentially increased risk of exposure. However, according to the international health regulations, countries with vulnerable populations and susceptible vector species can define their own yellow fever vaccine entry requirements. In Kenya, only North Eastern Province, Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Malindi and Tana River in Coast Province have been classified as areas with low potential for exposure. The new recommendations came up after recognition by travel medicine experts at WHO and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2008 of the need to harmonise both the classifications of geographical risk for yellow fever and vaccine recommendations. WHO then convened a consultation group on yellow fever and international travel to discuss factors important for transmission of the virus, to establish criteria for the addition or removal of countries and geographical regions and to revise the yellow fever risk map and recommendations for vaccination. The consultation group outlined four levels of yellow fever risk and classified geographical areas into four corresponding categories: endemic, transitional, low risk and no risk. In Africa, the barren or sparsely vegetated lands of the Sahara desert are not suitable for the development of immature mosquitoes and were, therefore, not thought to harbour a risk for transmission. The normalised difference in vegetation line was used to separate barren or sparsely vegetated zones as the criteria for the addition or removal of countries and geographical regions. The following countries in Africa had no change to their prevalence classification: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo (Brazzaville), Côte d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, French Guiana, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Suriname, The Gambia, Togo, and Uganda. These countries repeatedly reported yellow fever infection in human beings or non-human primates and had inadequate surveillance systems to establish whether the virus was circulating at low levels in specific areas. These were therefore classified as endemic (high risk) regions. The group agreed that countries with areas with only low potential for exposure be excluded from the list of countries with risk and such exemptions apply to Eritrea, Somalia, Tanzania, and Zambia. Yellow fever is an acute haemorrhagic disease caused by the yellow fever virus transmitted by a bite of female mosquitoes mostly found in Africa and South America. The incubation period for the virus is between two and five days. In Africa, transmission of the virus can also occur in an intermediate cycle between human beings or non-human primates. Symptoms occur in severe cases and include jaundice, multi-organ failure, and distributive shock. The yellow fever vaccine known as YF 17D vaccine has been regarded as one of the safest vaccines against the disease and lasts for four, five and 10 year interval between vaccinations. Yellow fever vaccine is given for two reasons: to protect travellers visiting areas with risk of yellow fever virus transmission and to prevent international spread by minimising the risk of importation and translocation of the virus by viral endemic travellers. Travellers immunised against Yellow Fever are issued with an internationally recognised vaccination certificate for inspection by immigration officials. The international health regulations concerning Yellow Fever are equal worldwide and unvaccinated travelers may face denial of entry, or even quarantine in certain circumstances. The International Certificate of Vaccination is then issued and becomes valid 10 days after vaccination and remains so for 10 years. However, WHO maintains that the immunity from yellow fever vaccine remains the same and vaccination is mandatory for travellers to and from these high risk countries as stipulated in the International Health Regulations (2005) for individuals travelling to countries with a yellow fever vaccination entry requirement.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
3033669,ebola,NGA,12/15/2014 5:57,0,"The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) yesterday in Enugu asked doctors and other health workers not to rest on their oars in the war against the dreaded Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) despite the certification of Nigeria as Ebola free by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Chairman of the NMA in Enugu, Dr George Ugwu gave the charge during the association's 2014 Physician's Week with the theme 'Victory against Ebola in Nigeria: Lessons Leant and other applications' held at the Toscana hotels, Enugu. Dr Ugwu observed that since the disease was still ravaging other neighbouring African nations, it was imperative for health workers, who were usually the first line of victims, to be on guard, while the rest of Nigerians should maintain the standard healthy hygiene. 'The theme of this year's celebration reminds us of that while we thank God that Nigeria won the war against Ebola, we should not just go and relax. Our hands should therefore be on deck to ensure that the lessons leant are utilised to prevent further entry of Ebola into the country,' he noted. Also speaking the Commissioner for Health, Enugu state, Dr George Eze said in as much as it was necessary for the people to be on guard, he was optimistic that the dreaded disease had been permanently stamped out of the state and country at large. 'I can tell you clearly that Ebola was surgically removed from the state within 6 hours of its entry into the state. All the necessary steps had been taken by the state government with support from Governor Sullivan Chime to ensure that health facilities and health personnel were put in proper shape in order not to have problem of Ebola here again,' he said. On her part, the chairman of the occasion and a senior director with the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, (UNTH), Prof Ifeoma Okoye stressed the need for medical practitioners to engage in recertification training programmes and examinations in order to effectively grapple with unfolding realities. Prof Okoye observed that the EVD came with an unusual dimension in the medical world, noting that medical professionals need to equally get themselves acquainted with modern realities in order not to be caught napping no matter the prevailing circumstance.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
503555,influenza,AUS,8/24/2010 4:07,0,"AT LEAST half of the Australian population now has immunity to swine flu, Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer Professor Jim Bishop says. Addressing a conference in Adelaide last week, Professor Bishop also flagged major changes to Australia’s pandemic management plan. He said after the first wave of the H1N1 pandemic, it was estimated around 20% of the population had some natural immunity. The rollout of 9.7 million doses of Panvax and around 6.4 million doses of 2010 seasonal influenza vaccine, which includes the H1N1 strain, had further boosted population protection, he said. “I’m fairly confident to say that now around 50% of our population has some degree of immunity,” he told MO. “I think it is much higher than that personally, but I am being conservative and saying it’s at least 50 per cent.” Professor Bishop addressed the 12th Public Health Association of Australia Immunisation Conference on the pandemic response. The nation had reacted flexibly as the pandemic unfolded, with the PROTECT phase being “invented” and inserted in the pandemic management plan as understanding grew about the biology of the virus, he said. Professor Bishop indicated that widespread criticism that the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza failed to take account of the reality of the relatively mild illness would be addressed in a formal evaluation now underway. However, the pandemic’s impact on the health system should not be underestimated, with hospital data showing 700 viral pneumonia admissions to ICUs in 2009, mainly in a three- to four-week period as the pandemic peaked, compared to around 55 per year for the previous five years, he said. Professor Robert Booy, head of clinical research at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said Australians should not downgrade what occurred during the pandemic. “To say there were so few deaths is to miss the point that there were so many deaths we don’t normally see in young people,” he said. Comparing the 191 pandemic flu deaths in Australia to the often-quoted figure of 2500 annual deaths from seasonal flu was “comparing an apple and an orange” because the seasonal toll was modelled from notifications, not proven deaths. A more valid comparison would be to look at laboratory-proven seasonal deaths recorded on death certificates, which was not more than 50 per year, he said.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
3128594,ebola,MLI,1/29/2015 8:44,0,"In September last year the Centers for Disease Control depicted a worst case scenario in which the number of people infected could reach 1.5 million by January 2015 without swift intervention, and the UN called for $1 billion to tackle the epidemic. Governments and aid agencies did respond, and the swell of humanitarian assistance has helped to contain its spread. In the week up to 18 January the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported a combined total of 145 new confirmed cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries most affected in the current outbreak. The Liberian government said late last week that there were now only five confirmed cases in the country, in comparison with the 300 new cases per week recorded in August and September. It has been an uphill battle to educate communities and overcome the various stigmas around sanitation and hospitals, but it appears to be paying off. Of course, before the virus is entirely eradicated, governments in the affected countries will be rightly fearful of complacency, especially as scientists have reported... 'People are very encouraged to see the numbers of new cases going down, but they also recognise that the battle will not have been won until there have been zero cases in all the provinces for at least 42 days,' said Sarah Wilson, Ebola response communications manager for World Vision. 'So far only two provinces have had zero cases for that length of time. It only took one case to start the outbreak. So I don't think people will relax for some time yet,' said Wilson, who has been based in Sierra Leone for the past two months. This is not a virus to underestimate. This outbreak has been the worst on record by a significant margin, with the WHO reporting more than 21,000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and more than 8,600 deaths, though actual figures could be higher. Outbreaks such as this don't just affect the nation's health. For every person who died, there will be repercussions – economic and social impacts on families, communities and nations. There are now four major challenges facing the world as the focus shifts from fire-fighting to planning for the future. Challenge 1. Infrastructure – The world is 'dangerously unprepared' The epidemic has exposed once again the fragile, underdeveloped infrastructure in the three main countries affected, all of which are among the poorest in the world. Liberia had only around 50 trained doctors for its 4 million population. Sierra Leone found it was radically short of hospital beds. In October, more than 1,100 beds were needed for Ebola patients and there were only 304 available for the country of 6 million people. There was also shortage of ambulances, and the fuel to run them. The WHO has also admitted that the response to Ebola was too slow. But this doesn't mean that it won't happen again. Dr Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank Group said this week that the world, not just Africa, is 'dangerously unprepared' for future pandemics like Ebola. Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO, also said that 'Ebola preyed on the fear of the unfamiliar. 'The disease was unexpected and unfamiliar to everyone, from clinicians and laboratory staff to governments and their citizens,' she said. One encouraging sign, however, is that the grave concerns about Ebola spreading across Africa, and even the world, have not been realised. There have been some cases in Nigeria, Mali and Senegal, but it has not been widespread, and it is generally thought that the virus was effectively controlled. Challenge 2. Economy – Africa is not a country Although fears that the whole region would be hit economically have been assuaged, the three main countries affected face huge economic challenges. In Liberia, almost half of household heads are unemployed, according to a recent World Bank report. And in Sierra Leone many small household enterprises have gone out of business or suffered a substantial reduction in trade. Sierra Leone was expected to see substantial economic growth in 2015 of 5-10 per cent, and instead its economy is shrinking, with Guinea heading in a similar direction. Although the Liberian economy is expected to grow this year, it is thought it will be at half the rate that it was before the outbreak. Investment plans were put on hold, and tourism declined. Public activities were reduced in an attempt to control the disease. Markets closed, and street vendors lost their source of income, and in Liberia non-essential government workers were sent home. According to The Economist, by November last year tour operators across Africa reported the biggest drop in business in living memory. This is partly owed to the fact that some think of Africa as a nation, not a continent, and was described by one travel agent as 'an epidemic of ignorance'. With headlines about the fear of Ebola spreading globally as a result of air travel, it's easy to see how anxieties emerge. David Evans, a senior economist at the World Bank, said: 'The vast majority of the economic impact of this crisis has been fear.' But if the fear hadn't been there, would the response to Ebola have been so strong? This week Oxfam called for a form of post-Ebola 'Marshall Plan' to prevent countries recovering from the virus from being hit by economic disaster. On a visit to Liberia, Oxfam GB's chief executive Mark Goldring said: 'People need cash in their hands now, they need good jobs to feed their families in the near future and decent health, education and other essential services. They've gone through hell, they cannot be left high and dry. 'The world cannot walk away now that, thankfully, cases of this deadly disease are dropping. Failure to help these countries after surviving Ebola will condemn them to a double-disaster. The world was late in waking up to the Ebola crisis, there can be no excuses for not helping to put these economies and lives back together.' Challenge 3. Family and Society – Back to school but not back to normal Schools in Liberia and Sierra Leone are due to open again in February, having been closed for months in an attempt to reduce interpersonal contact. But things won't necessarily return to normal. VICE News reports that a number of private Christian schools in Liberia, which are often thought to have a higher standard of education, may be forced to close as a result of the economic downturn. Many children have been emotionally traumatised by the outbreak – those who caught the virus will have experienced the fear and stigma associated with it, as well as the loneliness of quarantine, others have been orphaned. In recognition of the emotional trauma that people face, World Vision is training people in psychological first aid. Christian development agency Tearfund reported the story of one Liberian woman, Josephine, whose husband and two children died from Ebola. She also contracted the virus and was admitted to a clinic, but recovered and has taken six orphaned children from the clinic into her care. Stories of newly formed families are also paired with other, less comforting reports of people being rejected by family members or their communities after they have recovered over fears of the disease spreading. Josephine said: 'Since we returned from the Ebola Treatment Unit, it has not been easy for us to get food. Many people in the community that we were once close to are afraid of us.' Tearfund's partner organisation, EQUIP, has been distributing food parcels to households across Liberia who have been quarantined and consequently struggling to get food. One of the significant measures taken to control the virus was to change funeral practices, as the bodies of Ebola victims are still highly contagious after death. Although people were told to report the deaths, the bodies were disposed of without any opportunity for a ceremony. People were reluctant to call the teams, and so the protocol wasn't as effective as it might have been. World Vision has been working on a government-funded project in Sierra Leone to ensure the dead are given safe and dignified burials. Teams are trained to come to the home of the deceased in protective clothing, and safely, but solemnly remove the body and clean the home. Families are able to invite a member of clergy, either Muslim or Christian, to perform a ceremony. There have also been smaller societal changes, including in peoples' body language. 'Sierra Leoneans are a very expressive people who like to hug and touch each other,' said Wilson. 'It is difficult to avoid doing that, but people have taken that messaging very seriously. People touch their hands to their hearts and bow as a greeting now...it seems awkward at first, but everyone does it.' Challenge 4. Health – Ebola, one among many Many have made the comparison between Ebola and other diseases that have a crippling hold on a number of African nations, such as malaria and HIV. In 2013, 6.6 million people contracted malaria in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, and 20,000 people died from the disease. While it's difficult to argue that one disease is 'worse' than another, it is true that Ebola is one concern among many. A WHO report in December showed that although malaria deaths have fallen in recent years around the world, Ebola poses a risk of resurgence. This is partly a result of the stretch on medical resources; some of the – already limited – health clinics in Liberia were shut down as they became places of infection instead of treatment. And this in turn may have made people more reluctant to attend outpatient clinics, which have also seen a fall in numbers attending. The question over trial Ebola vaccines once again drew distinctions between The West and the Rest, with high-profile cases of Westerners being given experimental drugs, while the thousands in West Africa were not. But when the experimental drug ZMapp was sent out to Liberia in August it was seen as ethically questionable. There has been huge pressure to fast-track developments of possible vaccines and treatments. In November, clinical trials began in Sierra Leone and Guinea using the blood of Ebola survivors to help victims. At the start of January Médecins Sans Frontières began a clinical trial for an anti-viral drug in Liberia, and last week British pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline shipped its first trial vaccines to Liberia. Jon Pender, a vice-president of GSK, said at an event in Parliament last week: 'The reason we don't have a vaccine is because it wasn't a priority for anyone, and there are understandable reasons for that.... The number of people affected each year was very small and the overall disease burden, in comparison to other disease like malaria or HIV, is tiny. 'The fact is that in the 40 years that we have known about Ebola, including the present outbreak, there have been about 24,000 known cases. There are that many cases of malaria every hour.' But while a vaccine may one day eliminate the virus, it's clear that the same recurring faultiness of underdevelopment leave these countries – and particularly their economies – still vulnerable to attack. Ebola has proven to be a global challenge, though one that cost the poorest most, and international commitments are needed for the long haul, as much as ever as the death count falls.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
3070812,ebola,MLI,1/4/2015 19:15,0,"The Liberian American Community Organization of Southern California (LACOSC),in the USA, has donated a 40-foot container of medical supplies, mainly preventive gears to the government of Liberia as support to the fight against the Ebola Virus Disease that is inflicting havoc on their fellow citizens in Liberia. The action by the Community according to Mr. Samuel Hoff, Head of the organization in a statement is in support to the Liberian Government and the international community's effort to contain a virus that was sprawling out of control. The container contains 713 cartons of supplies that included; liquid bleach, gloves, surgical gowns, masks, respirators, towels and body bags amongst others and is worth over hundred thousand United States dollars ($100,000.00). Hoff said the container also has in it two (2) used EKG equipment units in excellent condition. Hoff said: 'These donations are the work of concerned Liberians in Southern California pulling resources together and soliciting help from friends and organizations in the Community. Many Liberians donated sacks of supplies, while others made cash donations. A few who work at major hospitals solicited medical supplies from their employers.' He further said the two major hospitals that contributed to the Liberian community were the Long Beach Memorial Hospital and the Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 'Special recognition goes to Dr. Grace Dinkins, a Liberian Medical Doctor at the Long Beach Memorial Hospital for engaging the hospital management to donate generously. We also applaud the efforts of Ms. Bintou Sanwon, a Nurse at Cedar Sinai Medical Center, who was also instrumental in having her hospital donate additional supplies as well,' stated. The LACOSS president disclosed that the organization has a membership of about 2,000 Liberians in Southern California, from Bakersfield to San Diego and has been in existence since the 70's, serving to bring Liberians as well as friends of Liberia together, to socialize and assist one another in time of need. The organization, according to its President Hoff currently has many students on scholarship,s both in Liberia and in the United States. He said, the group in July of 2014, under the administration of President Samuel Hoff III, assembled an Ebola Task Force to solicit preventive gears and raise funds to assist the fight against the Ebola Virus plaguing their beloved country. For his part Mr. David F. Beyan, the man charged with the responsibility to Coordinate and lead the LACOSC Ebola Task Force in the US state of California said, as the Ebola Virus intensified in Liberia and claimed international attention and brought panic to the American public, the Task Force seized the opportunity to create awareness and solicit donations to help in this fight against the virus. Beyan said: 'The People of Southern California responded, not only by donating supplies and cash, but by volunteering to assist with packing, labeling and transporting hundreds of boxes from storage facilities to the container. The Administration and the Task Force salute Liberians and their friends in Southern California for this spirit of compassion.' He paid special commendation to the LACOSC Administration; Samuel L. Hoff, III, President, William Thomas Bernard King, Vice President, Paulyn P. Beyan, Treasurer and Jartu McConnell, Advisor, for their unflinching support to the Task Force. All of whom also served on the Task Force. 'Special thanks to LACOSC's Board of Directors for its blessings and cooperation with the Task Force. 'Although, former LACOSC Executives, Mr. Lewis Free, former President and Mrs. Emily Guegbeh-Peal, former Vice President have both relocated to Liberia, they continue to lend support to worthy projects undertaken by LACOSC. The Community is delighted by their help,' Beyan said. Presenting the items on behalf of the organization, Mr. Lewis Free a senior member of the organization now residing in Liberia caution the Incident management team on Ebola to use the items to save lives and permanently eradicate the virus from the country. James Dorbor Jallah, Incident Manager for Support Services at the National Ebola Command Center in response to the donation commended Liberians in the US state of California for the thoughtfulness and challenges other Liberians in other part of the world to emulate the example of the group in California. He promised to use some of the mattresses in regular health centers and not Ebola treatment Unit (ETU) because according to him there are numbers of beds now empty in various ETU in the country making the mattresses useless in those centers.

Three new large dengue clusters in Woodlands, Pasir Ris and Seletar emerged yesterday, bringing the total to six.

Last week, 227 people came down with dengue - the highest weekly number in almost four years. It was also the third straight week that the number of cases has gone above the epidemic level.

2913118,enterovirus 68,USA,10/29/2014 14:33,0,"During the current (2014) enterovirus/rhinovirus season in the United States, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is circulating at an unprecedented level. As of [6 Oct 2014], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had confirmed 594 cases of EV-D68 infection in 43 states and the District of Columbia (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks.html); the actual number of cases was undoubtedly much higher. In mid-August [2014], hospitals in Missouri and Illinois noticed an increased number of patients with severe respiratory illness. We observed this pattern at St. Louis Children's Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Before the current season, only 7 whole-genome sequences and 5 additional complete coding sequences of the virus were available. Therefore, determining whether there are genomic elements associated with rapid spread or severe and unusual disease was not possible. To address these limitations, we determined the complete coding sequence of 1 strain from St. Louis by using high-throughput sequencing of nucleic acid from a clinical sample. To evaluate the sequence diversity in EV-D68 strains circulating in the St. Louis metropolitan area, we also generated partial-genome sequences from 8 more EV-D68-positive clinical samples from St. Louis. During the preparation of this article, CDC generated and submitted to GenBank 7 complete or nearly complete genome sequences from viruses obtained from the Midwest. We have documented the diversity of the sequences of strains from St. Louis and compared them to publicly available sequences. Patients were categorized retrospectively as having mild, moderate, or severe disease if they had been discharged home from the emergency unit, admitted to general wards, or admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, respectively. Residual material from a subset of nasopharyngeal specimens positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus were selected for high-throughput sequencing. [Details of the technical methods and the graphic presentation of the data have been omitted and interested readers should access the original text via the source URL.] EV-D68 sequences were detected in 7 of 10 samples from patients with severe disease, 2 of 2 with moderate disease, and 0 of 2 with mild disease. The complete coding sequence was assembled from sample EV-D68_STL_2014_12. Several of the genome sequences obtained from Missouri strains from this season, which had been sequenced by CDC, were very similar to this genome sequence. Comparison of the virus protein 1 sequence with that of publicly available sequences indicated that the strain from St. Louis and the strain from the Missouri cluster with virus strains identified in Europe and Asia within the past several years. The St. Louis virus shared 97-99 percent aa sequence identity with all other sequenced strains. We observed little variation in the strains from St. Louis because they shared 98-99 percent nt sequence identity. We provide a genome sequence from the 2014 outbreak of EV-D68 infection in St. Louis, Missouri. This sequence seems to be highly representative of the strains circulating in St. Louis during this time because the other genomes we partially sequenced are very similar. To our knowledge, no amino acids have been associated with virulence or increased infectivity of EV-D68; therefore, we cannot associate the changes we observed in these genomes to phenotypic traits. Because changes in the 5' untranslated region have the potential to affect the rate of replication, it is possible that minor genome changes are responsible for the rapid spread and high severity of disease in 2014. Correlation between clinical features of patients in conjunction with additional genomic analysis might provide further insight into the pathogenetic determinants of this strain. Therefore the genome sequence of EV-D68 determined from the 2014 outbreak in St. Louis, Missouri, provides a resource for tracking and genomic comparison of this rapidly spreading virus.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Disease Control reported that the risk of infection for Ebola in Europe is low. We asked the Chairman of the Development and Health Committee, how they assess the situation. According to the World Health Organization already 4,447 people have died of Ebola (14.10.). On 18 September, the European Parliament has responded in a resolution on the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. MEPs called it on the Commission to step up the fight against the virus. Europe must ensure that the health system is prepared for an Ebola outbreak, the British Social Democrat and chairman of the Development Committee called poverty and a lack of health care as reasons for the rapid spread of the virus in West Africa. 'In Europe, we have the good fortune to be better equipped' she said. The Italian chairman of the Health Committee Giovanni La Via (EPP) added that high standards of health and preventative measures reduced the risk of Ebola epidemic in Europe. Nevertheless, it is not possible to avoid individual cases. At the same time stressed La Vie, that there must be a guarantee that the euorpäische health system was prepared for Ebola and the virus can be treated in an emergency. How can the EU help the West African countries to contain the virus? McAvan himself is convinced that we must act quickly and coordinated in order to contain the virus.

The Indiana State Department of Health has quit its count of cases after it rose over 300. “They're just overloaded with testing,” according to Thomas. ISDH officials told the local coordinator to expect H1N1 vaccines in mid- to late October. They will be given to priority groups first: persons between 6 months and 24 years; persons who live with or care for children younger than 6 months (the shot is not recommended for infants under that age); pregnant women; persons 25-64 who are at higher risk because of chronic health disorders or compromised immune systems; and health care and emergency medical services personnel. At first Thomas was told the county initially would receive 14,000 doses, enough to vaccinate students at all public and private schools, even Batesville public schools that are located in Franklin County. Yet Aug. 31 she was notified 5,000 vaccines would be arriving, followed by 1,000 to 2,000 trickling in weekly. The county has about 28,000 residents. Its public school superintendents have been meeting weekly about the issue, prioritizing which students will get the first shots and deciding how to vaccinate larger groups. The coordinator wants to give the shots evenly throughout the county, perhaps a grade or two at a time, but the process hasn’t been nailed down. “The schools have been really great working with us, suggesting their own plans. It's been pretty awesome.” Parents will have to sign consent forms before their children receive the shots. “We've got the schools under control, we think,” she reported. “Now we’re working on how to get to day care centers.” Health department employees will provide vaccines to private physicians to give to pregnant women. Batesville Kroger pharmacists called Thomas to volunteer. “The other pharmacies are willing to work with us, too,” so some pharmacists also may be inoculating. If eventually there are enough vaccines to give to citizens not in the priority groups, Thomas is hopeful the county will be allowed to host drive-thru clinics at five public sites. She said leaders at ISDH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, are discouraging mass vaccination clinics, because “they don't want people exposing other people,” but getting shots while sitting in vehicles seems less risky than standing in long lines. The coordinator’s immediate goal is to keep residents aware of latest guidelines to curb the spread of the illness. Brochures and training CDs can be found at medical providers, schools and libraries. A public service message can be viewed at the Gibson Theatre. She has been meeting with school nurses and talking to the media. The plan is based on all volunteers and so far Thomas called the response 'outstanding. Each community is willing and eager to provide for their own.” Volunteers are required to take the National Incident Management System IS700a course either online or live and pass a test. Margaret Mary Community Hospital is offering a class Tuesday, Oct. 13, at 9 a.m., safety director Char Roberts said. Thomas predicted more volunteers, especially those who can give shots, will be needed. They must be NIMS-qualified and on her roster or county liability insurance will not cover them. She urged the 20 attendees to pass out volunteer brochures. If H1N1 “changes its mind and starts to get nasty (by mutating to a more lethal form) on us, some of our volunteers might be sick.” Those willing to help out can reach Thomas at 812-689-5751. MMCH community health improvement manager Geralyn Litzinger asked if persons still need the vaccine if they already were exposed to H1N1. “I've been told to vaccinate” was the coordinator’s answer. The flu strain is changing, so an immunization still is needed, explained Susan Gross, ISDH Public Health Preparedness and Emergency Response Division District 9 planning coordinator. Thomas is encouraging everybody to get seasonal flu shots, either at county health departments, MMCH flu shot clinics or stores. “This will not prevent H1N1, but will help you keep healthy to fight off H1N1.” About 36,000 people die each year in the United States due to seasonal flu-related illnesses. The seasonal flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over 6 months, ISDH officials said. Receipt of this vaccine is particularly important for young children, individuals with chronic diseases or compromised immune systems and persons over 65. Residents seem to agree with Thomas’ advice. Last year 1,300 received seasonal flu shots at a drive-thru session at the Batesville firehouse. On Sept. 3 that number increased to 1,500 in three and a half hours, Litzinger reported.

2883193,ebola,SEN,10/20/2014 11:25,0,"West Africa's Ebola outbreak, which has been disrupting agricultural and market activities, threatens to erode food security and negatively affect the livelihoods of millions of already vulnerable people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone unless more is done to meet their immediate food and nutritional needs, say aid agencies. They say they are still calculating the number of food insecure households, but already the results of initial rapid assessments are worrying. The World Food Programme (WFP) found that more than 80 percent of people surveyed via mobile phone in the eastern part of Sierra Leone say they have been eating less expensive food since the outbreak began. Three-quarters of respondents have begun to reduce the number of daily meals and portion sizes. 'I'm very concerned about having enough food every day,' said Sheku Conteh, a street trader in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. 'The Ebola has caused a lot of strain right now. There's no business and no jobs. and I'm having difficulty providing food for my family,' he said. 'I have to starve myself much of each day just to save a bit from my sales to get food for my family.' A rapid assessment survey last month in Sierra Leone by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) found that 47 percent of farmers have had their work 'considerably disrupted' by the Ebola outbreak. 'Here, we have the largest cocoa farms,' said Sidikie Kabba, a farmer from eastern Sierra Leone. 'Now it's quarantined because of Ebola, so people aren't travelling. Before, I was harvesting my produce - up to 50 bags - but now even 10 bags is difficult. So I'm losing money,' he said. While Kabba stayed behind, many farmers stopped going to their fields during the most critical stage of the agricultural cycle - in July and August this year - when there was widespread misunderstanding of the disease. In Sierra Leone's Kailahun District in the east, at least 40 percent of farmers abandoned their land to move to non-affected areas according to the Minisrty of Agriculture. Many seasonal migrant workers, who normally help with harvesting have been either too afraid to work alongside others in the fields or unable to travel due to quarantine restrictions. 'You alone, you are not able to do large work,' said Yankouba Vandi, who grows coffee and cocoa in Sierra Leone's Kenema District. 'In the past, you can receive some manpower to help you to work, but for now, they will not allow that.' Rice production down In Liberia, rice production decreased by 10 percent in Lofa County this year because of fear among farmers, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In Barkedu and Foya counties, rice production fell by 15 percent. The results of a four-week joint assessment on the impact of Ebola on food security, livestock and agriculture in Guinea, which is now under way by the Ministry of Agriculture, FAO and WFP, will not be available until mid-November, but Gueckedou's Prefectural Directorate for Agriculture says that the total land area that was cultivated this year has 'considerably declined' compared to past years. Closed markets and disruptions in trade, transportation and people's movements, have also led to food shortages in many communities across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, particularly those in border areas. 'Right now we are having a hard time getting regular supplies from farmers and other suppliers,' said Adama Conteh, who sells rice and vegetables in Freetown's Bombay Terrace. Most of the areas we normally buy from are very hard to go to now because of this Ebola. Many of the farmers are afraid to go to their farms and harvest, or even come to Freetown with their products,' she said. Along the border of Guinea and Senegal, at least 16 weekly markets have been shut down, according to WFP. In Liberia, many of the weekly markets also remain officially closed. Food prices up, incomes down In places where food is still available, some prices are going up. In Liberia's Lofa County, for example, the country's former epicenter of the outbreak, food and commodity prices rose between 30 and 75 percent between April and September, according to FAO. Certain types of fish are now five times more expensive than before the outbreak began. In Sierra Leone, the price of imported rice increased by upwards of 15 percent in some areas, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). This is compounded by the fact that household incomes and savings are decreasing, as people are either unable, or too afraid, to work. And as more and more people contract the virus or die from it, families are also losing key sources of revenue. 'We believe this disruption in market chains and trade, which have increased the prices of certain commodities and decreased quality, is also affecting people's incomes,' said Vincent Martin, head of FAO's West Africa resilience hub. 'So it's not just a problem of food production, but with this impact on the incomes of vulnerable people, we will almost certainly see a deterioration of purchasing power in these households.' Women hit by market disruptions To help ease some of these impacts and reduce the risk of rising food insecurity, FAO says it plans to support 90,000 households across the most affected Ebola communities over the coming year. Through a combination of activities related to saving lives and protecting livelihoods, FAO plans to work with its partners to raise community awareness about Ebola, train health workers, build up local health systems to be better prepared for disease threats and improve response coordination efforts, while increasing agricultural production, boosting incomes through cash transfer schemes and supporting microfinance initiatives. 'We have to be aware of the situation and we have to react quickly so that we don't have, in addition to this health problem, a major food security crisis,' Martin said. In Liberia, where women have been particularly hard hit by market disruptions, as they account for an estimated 70 percent of cross-border trade, FAO plans to give an estimated 2,500 families from local women's associations cash transfers in exchange for helping spread Ebola awareness messages in their communities. They will also be given vegetable seeds to grow during the dry season, to help bring in some extra income. WFP says it has already delivered more than 9.1 million tons of food to 534,000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea since April. They plan to reach a total of nearly 1.4 million people by the end of February. This might not, however, be enough. Contingency plans needed Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) current caseload projection of 200,000-250,000 Ebola cases by early 2015, FEWS NET says that between 2.7 and 4 million people could reach at least a Phase 3, or crisis level, of food insecurity by March. 'It's difficult to say with any confidence what the numbers will be in six months,' said Chris Hillbruner, FEWS NET's decision support adviser, and lead technical analyst on the Ebola-impact project. 'But if we continue to see this exponential increase and if the CDC's predicted caseload were to occur, the concern is that we will see significant food gaps among populations both directly and indirectly affected by Ebola.' Hillbruner said that while the priority should still be to focus all efforts on the prevention, treatment and containment of the Ebola outbreak, the best way to prevent a large-scale food crisis is to have a contingency plan in place. 'We don't want to be overly alarmist, but we want to make sure that we are preparing now,' he said. 'You don't want to wait for the numbers to start spiking and then start a larger response. Ebola is already having an impact on food security, so it's important that this planning is going on now and that we are prepared, so that we won't face a major problem with food security and nutrition in six months from now.'",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2993467,ebola,GBR,11/26/2014 23:05,0,"An experimental Ebola vaccine causes no serious side effects and produces an immune response in all 20 healthy volunteers who received it in a clinical trial, scientists say. The GlaxoSmithKline vaccine has been found to trigger an immune response in 20 healthy volunteers in a clinical trial. (Credit: Reuters) An experimental Ebola vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline caused no serious side effects and produced an immune response in all 20 healthy volunteers who received it in an early-stage clinical trial, scientists reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial, which began on September 2 and will monitor the volunteers for 48 weeks, is primarily aimed at assessing how safe the vaccine is. But the immune response offered hope that it would also be effective. 'The safety profile is encouraging, as is the finding that the higher dose of vaccine induced an immune response quite comparable to that which has completely protected [lab] animals from Ebola,' said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is conducting the trial in Bethesda, Maryland. The intramuscular vaccine was developed at NIAID and Okairos, a biotechnology company acquired by GlaxoSmithKline. Because it is unethical to expose volunteers to Ebola, researchers assess the effectiveness of candidate vaccines by whether they trigger production of anti-Ebola antibodies and immune-system T cells. The trial enrolled volunteers aged 18 to 50. Half received a lower dose and half a higher dose. All 20 developed anti-Ebola antibodies within four weeks, with those on the higher dose producing more. Dose also affected production of T cells; seven of 10 people on the high dose produced one crucial kind of T cell, but only two on the low dose did. The higher the dose required to trigger immunity, the more challenging and expensive it will be to produce large quantities of vaccine, manufacturers said. Dr Daniel Bausch of Tulane University, who wrote an accompanying commentary, called the results promising but cautioned that there are many more challenges ahead before the vaccine's safety and efficacy are established. Another GlaxoSmithKline vaccine is undergoing safety trials in England, Mali and Switzerland, while one from Iowa-based NewLink Genetics is being tested in Maryland. This week, Merck announced that it would buy the rights to NewLink's vaccine for $50 million. A trial of an Ebola vaccine from Johnson & Johnson is scheduled to start in January. ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

90736,malaria,IND,6/26/2008 17:20,NA,"PUDUCHERRY: If you are suffering from fever and symptoms of shivering, sweating, then it is time to test for malaria. Timely blood tests and appropriate treatment would come a long way in preventing complications. With June being observed as the National Malaria Control month, the Urban Health Centre of Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) conducted an awareness programme and exhibition for public and students on Thursday. Addressing the gathering, Assistant Director of Malaria and Filaria N. Nilamani highlighted the importance of testing for malaria and strategies to control mosquito breeding. “Urbanisation is one of the reasons for mosquito breeding. There are two types of malaria — that caused by plasmodium vivax and plasmodium falciparum,” he said. Of this, plasmodium falciparum was dangerous and could lead to death if treatment was not provided within 48 hours, he said and added that the species was found in places such as Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya and West Bengal. “Plasmodium falciparum is not found in Puducherry but visitors from other States could bring the species here. Several persons from Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa are involved in construction activities in Puducherry,” Dr. Nilamani said. He elaborated on the places of mosquito breeding, identification of mosquitoes through its sitting postures, preventive measures and treatment. “Mosquitoes, which cause malaria, breed in clean water such as in sumps, over head tanks and vessels. It is important to close the sumps and tanks properly to prevent breeding and use the water collected in vessels within seven days,” he emphasised. Short play Doctors from JIPMER enacted a short play on mosquito-borne diseases and ways to prevent them. This was followed by the screening of a short film on prevention and control measures, symptoms and treatment for malaria, filaria, dengue and chikungunya. The exhibition consisted of posters on breeding sources of culex, aedes and anopheles mosquitoes and strategies for control. Use of insecticide treated mosquito nets and avoiding water stagnation in and around houses was also conveyed through posters. Chief Medical Officer of the centre K.

2942358,ebola,SEN,11/10/2014 4:48,0,"Study bats for ways to fight virus- researchers Bats are living up to their frightening reputation in the world's worst Ebola outbreak as prime suspects for spreading the deadly virus to humans, but scientists believe they may also shed valuable light on fighting infection. Bats can carry more than 100 different viruses, including Ebola, rabies and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), without becoming sick themselves. While that makes them a fearsome reservoir of disease. It also opens the intriguing possibility that scientists might learn their trick in keeping killers like Ebola at bay. Clues are starting to emerge following gene analysis, which suggest bats' capacity to evade Ebola could be linked with their other stand-out ability -- the power of flight. Flying requires the bat metabolism to run at a very high rate, causing stress and potential cell damage, and experts think bats may have developed a mechanism to limit this damage by having parts of their immune system permanently switched on. The threat to humans from bats comes en route to the dinner plate. Bushmeat -- from bats to antelopes, squirrels, porcupines and monkeys -- has long held pride of place on menus in West and Central Africa. The danger of contracting Ebola lies in exposure to infected blood in the killing and preparation of animals. Senegal boosts awareness via SMS: Senegal's first and only case of Ebola virus disease was confirmed in a young man who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Guinea and then travelled, by road, to Dakar. Together with WHO and partners, the Government of Senegal launched an immediate, broad-based and well-coordinated response that stopped the virus dead in its tracks. As part of a massive public awareness effort, Senegal's Ministry of Health sent 4 million SMS messages to the general public warning of the dangers of Ebola and how to prevent it. The messages, driven by the WHO-supported 'mDiabetes' platform, were targeted at people living in the capital city of Dakar and St-Louis, a heavily populated region in the country. Through the SMS campaign, launched in partnership with major mobile phone operators in Senegal, people were encouraged to alert health authorities of anyone showing signs of a fever and bleeding by calling a toll-free number. The messages were shared ahead of large-scale public events, including football matches and rallies. Senegal's SMS Ebola campaign could be rolled out at top speed thanks to an existing platform designed to help people living with diabetes manage their condition. Lessons from Nigeria on keeping Ebola at bay: It may be too early to celebrate Nigeria's ability to control the highly contagious and fast-spreading Ebola virus. Only after the epidemic has been controlled in the three badly affected West African nations, namely Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, can Nigeria, and indeed the whole of Africa, 'celebrate.' However, the fact that the World Health Organisation (WHO) officially announced that Africa's most populous nation had 'eliminated' one of the world's deadliest haemorrhagic fever viruses is the strongest indicator that what Nigeria did needs to be cautiously documented by the surviving hands-on local health experts. The brave and brilliant local doctors who quickly detected the doomsday virus helped set the national healthcare system on the move to control and curb the epidemic, and no case of Ebola has been reported in Nigeria since August 31, 2014. Nigeria now needs to help her less fortunate neighbours because the chances of those infected with Ebola entering Nigeria or any of her other nearby nations cannot be ruled out. Nigeria gave Africa its first virologists over six decades ago while others have worked in some of the world's leading infectious diseases labs. In East Africa, the now retired Dr Peter Tukei stands out as the leading hands-on expert on Haemorrhagic Fever Viruses (HFV) and was involved in the construction of a high-security bio-safety lab at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) with US support. However, Nigeria did not need any help from East Africa, where Uganda and Kenya have had cases of Marburg HFV. Unless the world doubles its efforts to help the three badly affected West African nations to overcome the disaster, some families, villages and even communities will be wiped out.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2650548,ebola,SLE,8/1/2014 0:34,NA,"The Ebola virus has caused Sierra Leone to proclaim a state of public emergency and Hobart local Isaiah Lahai has been affected directly after losing eight members of his family to the deadly outbreak. Mr Lahai’s parents, siblings and extended family are living in Sierra Leone and the recent outbreak is causing him some concern. “I’m very worried because I’ve lost eight members of the family presently to Ebola and that’s really worrying me, not for those who have died but those still alive,” he said. The spread of the virus through his home country is clearly having an impact on Mr Lahai as he nervously sits before speaking. “Everyday I wake and I ask myself, ‘when am I going to see my parents? When am I going to see my mother? Am I going to live a life to see them or would there be the opportunity one day to see them?’ “Taking away eight of my family members alone is very stressful and emotionally draining me down but at the same time I have to be very strong,” said Mr Lahai. At first his family were reluctant to share the full details of how the outbreak had affected them saying they were concerned how he would react. “Initially they were hiding some of the details from me because there were close members within the family that died and they thought if they told me I could be really stressed. “When they told me of the other death that occurred recently it really hurt me,” he said. Having lived in Tasmania for the past eight years, Mr Lahai understands the difficultly of explaining the full extent and reality of the disease to those far from the affected regions. “What I would like the Tasmanian community to know is Ebola is a deadly virus and Ebola is real and Ebola is killing people in the whole Sahara and African region,” he said. Ebola virus explained What is Ebola, and how does this highly contagious and deadly disease spread? It’s difficult for Mr Lahai to speak while his home country and family are suffering as a result of Ebola, but he is telling his story as he feels the best thing he can do is spread awareness. “I am a son, and I have got my mother, my father and extended relatives and my responsibility is to care for them and look after them as they age. “At the same time I have to stand strong and fight and also advocate to see how best we can mobilise support to help combat the spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone,” he said. The Sierra Leone community in Hobart has been contacted by the Sierra Leone government requesting assistance and supplies to help the spread of Ebola. “That’s why we are raising this awareness, speaking out, encouraging Tasmanians to stand with us in this time of need to support the people of Sierra Leone,” he said.

2935569,ebola,LBR,11/6/2014 17:57,0,"On a dirt field between two tall plum trees, barefoot young women played a surprisingly ferocious game of kickball one evening this week in Monrvoia, Liberia. Sweating in the heat and humidity despite the approach of dusk, they battled with the pent-up energy of teens who have been stuck at home too long. A crowd of 100, maybe more, gathered to watch. Huge speakers blared the Ghanain hip-hop of Sargo D, making conversation nearly impossible. The spectators stood closely together. Some danced, some moved more subtly to the music. Had there been food and drink, this gathering in Monrovia's Capitol Hill neighbourhood could have been a block party. Barely six or seven weeks ago, it also would have been impossible. On my first trip to Liberia, near the height of the Ebola epidemic in September, this field was always empty. As the virus tore unchecked through neighbourhood after neighbourhood, schools were closed, workplaces were shuttered, sporting events were canceled, crowds at the markets thinned and informal gatherings like the one Tuesday were not to be attempted. But now, ever so slowly, signs of normalcy are returning to the capital. With the rate of new Ebola infections down, traffic is up. Boys play soccer and girls play kickball, less afraid of skin-to-skin contact than they were a few short weeks ago. Businesses are welcoming back a few workers — not many, and not all at once, but some. Discussions have begun about when and how to reopen the schools without reigniting the epidemic. Perhaps in January, some say. For visitors like me, the reduction in tension is palpable. We wear short-sleeve shirts now, less fearful of a chance encounter with the virus. When we visit the treatment centers, as we did in September, there are no desperately ill children lying on the filthy concrete outside, no visibly sick adults sitting in the dirt or the back of a taxi, waiting for hours to get in. There is no one waiting. Many beds are empty, and new ones are about to open. Redemption Hospital, the symbol of Liberia's inability to keep up with the sick and the dead, has been closed. So has JFK Hospital's Ebola unit, a cholera facility that was quickly converted to handle the new disease when it burst from hiding. 'Fear of Ebola now is going down. It was scary for us,' said Mohammed Kanneh, a young man watching the kickball game. 'But we cannot forget. We still do the prevention procedures. We still wash our hands.' Indeed, no one believes Ebola is yet gone. The virus has shown in the past that it can recede, then flare up even more virulently than before. Plastic buckets filled with diluted chlorine seem to be outside the door of every business that can afford one, and security guards rigorously enforce the hand-washing requirement on anyone who tries to enter. There are even more billboards warning people not to take the lethal virus lightly. 'Ebola Na Play-Play,' screams one. Ebola doesn't screw around. But children will be kept under wraps for only so long. 'Gradually, the kids are coming together,' said Geovani Brooks, chairman of the Ebola Emergency Task Force in Dolo's Town, a community of about 15,000 an hour outside Monrovia that was quarantined for 21 days when the virus raged through. 'We are not encouraging that,' Ambrose Wureh, director of the Coalition Against Ebola, quickly interjected. 'There is a need to still wait.' The truth is that many Liberians never retreated very far from the virus, even in September and early October, when Ebola was doing its worst damage. In an amazing display of courage, resolve or lack of options, many went on about their lives, accepting the risk of infection by riding in taxis or jostling in the market. Their odds were pretty good: In a country of more than 4.1 million people, 6,525 have been infected and 2,697 have died, according to the World Health Organization. But those caught by the virus faced a 60 per cent to 90 per cent chance of dying, depending on whether they could find a bed in a treatment center, and how far the disease had progressed if they did. People who were out of work, however, had no money for food and other necessities. Businesses suffered. 'I tried to stay open,' said Amadou Barry, a tailor in Monrovia. 'Business just went down slowly, slowly, and in the end, it just went off.' Recently, however, Barry has been able to work a few days a week for part of the day, making suits, mending clothes and selling clothing retail. 'We are feeling the difference,' he said. 'Because the information is going around. The reduction [in the number of Ebola cases] is encouraging people to come around.' Frank Mahoney heads the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team in Liberia. As we sat over lunch one day this week, he described the reaction he and other experts received in neighbourhood after neighbourhood as they tried to intervene to halt the virus. The experience was a truncated version of the five stages of grief. First, Mahoney said, came denial. Many people did not believe Ebola was real and wanted no part of outsiders — Westerners, the Liberian government or aid groups — telling them what to do. Next came recognition, as Ebola began killing their relatives, friends and neighbours. Finally came a request for help as they realised they could not fight Ebola alone. They 'learn by people dying,' Mahoney said. Liberians have a greeting they reserve for friends. 'How da body?' they say when they run into someone they know. It is essentially, 'How are you doing?' Liberia's body is beginning to heal. It has a long way to go. It could suffer a relapse at any time. But it is in better shape than it was when I saw it last, when Ebola had left it weak and waiting for help.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

The State Ministry official also appealed to friendly countries and foreign business partners in Liberia to remain operational even in the face of the present heath emergency, noting that the suspension of flights to Liberia due to the Ebola outbreak could be against the fight to eliminate the disease from the country. Ambassador Wesseh spoke recently to foreign partners and Liberians in USA where he had gone to lobby on behalf of the government and people of Liberia. He said it will not serve a useful purpose to isolate Liberia due to the outbreak of the Ebola; instead he advised that medical support to Liberia be increased to help the country contain the deadly virus disease not only from the Mano River Union basin. He lauded the U.S Government and other friendly nations for their speedy intervention in the fight against this strange disease; noting that the country is facing difficulties with containing the Ebola viral disease. At the same time, Ambassador Wesseh said the present Ebola situation in Liberia has posed a major challenge that has continued to overwhelm the capacity of the Liberian Government to combat it. Minister Wesseh said the Ebola situation in the country has grown to the point where the government alone cannot fight the virus, and has therefore called on friendly countries and international partners to make substantive efforts in assisting the government to combat the disease. Although the government has made tremendous efforts since the outbreak of the Ebola disease in the country, the Minister of State without Portfolio, said the country continues to be faced with many challenges that need international assistance to address. at the Agriculture fare Minister Wesseh indicated that medical experts are urgently needed in Liberia to join their local counterparts to combat the virus, stressing that the level of the outbreak sends a strong signal to all Liberian citizens and partners to engage. The government, he explained, would not achieve its objective of driving the Ebola virus out of the country unless the international community and donors stand by Liberia in the fight against the deadly virus. He noted that the fear of the Liberian Government has been the rapidness with which the disease is spreading may affect every productive sector and wipe out a very significant portion of the population if nothing is done by the international community, saying that any further delay in the intervention may cause the entire sub-region to collapse. The State Minister without Portfolio, a son of River Gee County, is urging all Liberians irrespective of tribe, creed, religion, or political affiliation to stop politicizing the Ebola issue in the country. Mr. Wesseh reiterated that this is not the time for blame-shifting, asserting that the time has come for all to see the fight as a national battle aimed at containing the spread of the virus and eliminating the disease.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2706113,ebola,LBR,8/20/2014 2:58,NA,"The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) struck at the heart of Nigeria, when Dr. Ameyo Stella Adadevoh, a consultant physician, and member of the illustrious Kwaku Adadevoh/Herbert Macaulay/Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowder lineage succumbed to the scourge of the disease. Adadevoh contracted the virus from the Liberian, Mr. Patrick Sawyer, who imported the disease into Nigeria. Sources close to Adadevoh, 58, said she succumbed to the disease yesterday evening, having been in a coma for some days. Adadevoh, who is survived by one son, had led the medical team at First Consultants Medical Centre, a Lagos-based hospital, which treated Sawyer on his arrival in Lagos. As the head of operations at First Consultants, Adadevoh was praised for being the first to detect that Sawyer, who was admitted at First Consultants for five days before his death, was not being truthful when he denied that he was infected with the Ebola virus. After he had tested negative for malaria and other diseases, she was said to have ordered that his blood be tested for Ebola. It was the positive result of the test that enabled the hospital to contact the Lagos State health authorities about the first Ebola patient in the country. Her death brings to five, including the index case Sawyer, the total number of persons who have succumbed to the scourge of the disease in Nigeria. Among those who have passed on, Adedavoh is the first doctor and the fourth Nigerian to have died from the virus. Others who died before her comprised two nurses and the ECOWAS protocol officer, Jatto Abdulqudir, who picked up an already infected Sawyer from the Murtala Muhammad International Airport (MMIA), Lagos. However, five others who contracted the disease from Sawyer have been discharged while two others remain in the isolation ward at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, Lagos. Prior to Adadevoh’s death, her family and colleagues had held a press briefing in Lagos appealing to the US government to intervene to keep her from dying. They felt that the medical care she was getting in the isolation ward was insufficient and had called on the US government to send the ZMapp trial drug to save her life. Adadevoh comes from an illustrious family of physicians, politicians, statesmen and clerics. Her father, the late Dr. Babatunde Kwaku Adadevoh, was a renowned Harvard University-trained physician and former vice-chancellor of the University of Lagos, while her grandmother was the daughter of Sir Herbert Samuel Macaulay, a foremost politician and founder of Nigerian nationalism in the early 1940s. Macaulay himself was the grandson of Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, who was ordained the first African Bishop of the Anglican Church in Nigeria in 1864, making Dr. Ameyo Adadevoh, his great-great-great-grand daughter. The Adadevoh family can trace their roots to the Creoles in Sierra Leone, Ghana and South-west Nigeria. Ogun Detains Guinean Travellers Meanwhile, the Ogun State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Olaokun Soyinka, yesterday disclosed that four travellers coming into the country from Guinea through an illegal border area in Imeko-Afon Local Government Area of Ogun State have been detained and were being monitored by the state government in its efforts to prevent the spread of the dreaded Ebola virus. Guinea was the first country where the virus was detected in West Africa almost six months ago before it spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone. Soyinka, who disclosed this at a press conference in his office in Abeokuta yesterday, said response teams have been put in place at the local government area levels who serve as surveillance teams. According to him, they had been detained because they could not convince the border authorities that they had not been in contact with patients who had contacted the virus. He added that the circumstances of their crossing was a bit worrying, 'they were told until they could convince the authorities, they have to go back or if they were to come to Nigeria, they have to observe them”. He explained that the travellers who were coming from Guinea en route Nigeria agreed to be in the area for monitoring for the next 21 days. 'So they are staying there, they are not being quarantined but agreed voluntarily to wait while they are being observed to ensure that they have no symptoms,” he said. While reassuring residents that the state is free of the virus, Soyinka stated that in addition to further training of the healthcare workers, there was refresher information and further sensitisation at the border areas. According to him, the state currently has three quarantine and isolation centres in each of the three senatorial districts of the state, and urged the public to cooperate fully with the efforts of the state government in the interest of their health. He reiterated that the virus could only be contacted through body fluids of an infected person not by just sitting with the person, advising the public to maintain personal hygiene with regular hand washing and the use of sanitisers. The commissioner further advised that unnecessary physical contact at public gatherings should be avoided, saying: “Do not travel to areas where the epidemic is active, avoid hunting and eating bush meat. If you suspect Ebola, contact the health authorities immediately.” He said the state government was compiling a list of volunteers who could be called upon for a variety of tasks to alleviate the disease.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

Oxfam will be providing clean water, sanitation and food to over one million people and XXXXXX Oxfam launches $4 million appeal to help millions of Zimbabweans facing growing cholera and hunger crisis International agency Oxfam today launched a $4 million public appeal to address the lethal cholera and hunger crisis that is rapidly deteriorating across Zimbabwe. Oxfam will be providing clean water, sanitation and food to over one million people and is calling on the public and international donors to support the emergency appeal as it substantially scales up its efforts in the country. More than 5 million Zimbabweans now need food aid, in some locations only 1 in 10 farmers have seeds to plant for the coming growing season and many people are being forced to take increasingly desperate measures such as selling livestock and engaging in prostitution in order to survive. A shortfall in donations from the international community to the World Food Programme has forced Oxfam to cut the food rations each person receives by fifteen per cent. Jane Cocking, Humanitarian Director of Oxfam said: The rapid deterioration of the situation in Zimbabwe makes this an extremely grave humanitarian crisis which could deteriorate even further in 2009. While the international community battles for a political solution in the country, millions of Zimbabweans are going hungry. Oxfam is able to get clean water and food through to people who need it most. We need to respond now, there is no time to lose. In order to stem the growth of cholera, Oxfam is currently distributing hygiene kits, which include water purification tablets and soap, to 620,000 people as well as providing food rations to 250,000. A further 425,000 people are being helped through urban public health programmes such as drilling boreholes to provide clean water supplies. Cholera, a water-born disease, continues to rise with the latest figures from the UN showing that it has infected 18,000 people and killed about 800 with many more deaths and infections are believed to have gone unrecorded. Cholera is now affecting nine out of Zimbabwe s ten provinces and is likely to spread further if, as expected, there are more heavy rains in the next month. The breakdown of public water systems and health services means help is vital to protect people from cholera. Unchecked, it will to contribute to many more deaths, and poses a particular threat to those with HIV, which is one in seven Zimbabweans. Peter Mutoredzanwa, Oxfam Zimbabwe Country Director, said: The average Zimbabwean woman can only expect to live 33 years and the tragic fact is that unless we respond now, many more people will not live to see their 30s. Zimbabweans are no strangers to food shortages but we have now reached desperate levels. Some children only eat a meager portion of food once every three days and people scavenge in rubbish dumps for anything they can eat.

Photographs - available on request In studio interviews: Adam Berthoud - Regional Humanitarian Advisor (Johannesburg), Jon Slater - Oxfam spokesperson (Johannesburg) Notes to Editors: Quotes from people affected by the hunger and cholera crisis in Zimbabwe From Oxfam food distribution centres in Chirurmanzu province An unnamed traditional leader said: I know of at least six people from three households around my area who have actually died because of hunger. A person cannot live on wild fruit alone. There are people who suffer from AIDS who are on medication. If that person takes medication and only had wild fruit to eat, there is no way they will survive. They will die. Those are the majority of cases who have died. Sungai Manhovo, a traditional leader mans the helpdesk at the feeding station. He said: The people getting food are not so hungry but there are too few people getting food. Those who don t get any are starving. There are a lot people who don t get food who need it, almost as many as do get food. Nkosana Mudhindi , an old man sat on the floor of the feeding station, said: I have 14 in my house but of these fourteen only six are getting food rations. Two of my children have already died (of hunger). How am I supposed to manage? People have been eating nuts and wild fruit but that is now almost gone. Mabuya Mawire , an old woman, looked out over her barren fields. She said: It is not that we are lazy or can t cultivate our land. If I get seed I will plant it today. We have dug up some ground in case we get seed. We have tried planning grain we were given as food. If you soak maize grain in water you can tell which grains will grow. But we did not succeed. In this village there are very few people who have planted anything because there is no seed. You cant find seed in the shops and if you do find some then it is 300 Rand(SA) for 5kg. We do not have that much money. I do not know what we will do. I hope Oxfam stays here for a while. From Kadoma where Oxfam is drilling and renovating boreholes to provide clean water Zondiwe Phiri , secretary of a community water committee in Kadoma. She said: The borehole has benefited the community because there was a shortage of water. Using the borehole we can get water anytime. Before there was no water. We were often without water for days. People were getting water from dirty wells and other unsafe places. Many people walked 2kms to get water from near a sewerage pond. Darlington Zulu, 28, is training as a pump mechanic in Kadoma as part of a programme run by Oxfam and partners Practical Action. He said: When there was an electricity cut there was no water. This is good news simply because there is a hand-pump that doesn t need electricity at all. My Dad was infected by cholera. He was ill for 4 or 5 days, acting like someone who was crazy and losing weight. He started vomiting and had a runny stomach I have two sons, one age four and one and a half years. We have to keep them inside if they go out we fear they will get contaminated by cholera. You don t want your children to go next door for water because you do not know what their hygiene is like. When there is no water you can t cook, you can t wash your clothes, you can t wash your clothes. The pump will help provide health. The problem of cholera is at an end.

Kenya, an important gateway for the African region, one of the countries by the World Health Organization ranked on the list of countries at risk of outbreak of Ebola, is conducting a campaign ready response to the epidemic. Government of Kenya is to implement a campaign to help people raise awareness and know how to prevent Ebola epidemics. Kenya Ministry of Health has prepared the quarantine center and train 10,000 health workers across the country to respond promptly when necessary. On 28/10, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has instructed the Ministry of Health conducted cabinet meeting to discuss measures to prevent Ebola epidemics. Chief Cabinet Yoshihide Suga said the meeting in order to improve the preventive measures in the context of Ebola epidemic is spreading. Abe has asked the Ministry of Health prepared to respond to the epidemic of Ebola. In addition, many countries have also enacted restrictions travel warning for those who come from the Ebola epidemic, including the medical staff. The Australian government decided to stop granting visas to people from the West African country's outbreak of Ebola. Minister of Immigration and Border Protection Australia Scott Morrison said: ""The government wants strict control of entry for people from West Africa to Australia. These measures include the suspension of immigration programs, including humanitarian programs for countries affected by Ebola virus, and this may think that we will not solve any application visa from the country. ""However, in a statement released on 27/10, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that the restrictions on entry to the back from the Ebola epidemic is difficult for medical staff working here. Spokesman of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Satephane Dujarric said: ""The UN Secretary General said that the travel restrictions are causing enormous pressure on the medical staff and the at the forefront of the fight against Ebola. The medical personnel returning from endemic areas should be the exception, not the subject of this restriction. They need support, not stigmatized.

General David Rodriguez, head of U.S. forces in Africa, said three mobile labs had deployed to Liberia and four more were being sought to run tests that would distinguish between people infected with Ebola and those who have diseases with similar symptoms, such as malaria. Each lab would be staffed by a team of three to four experts trained to operate in the worst chemical, biological and nuclear environments, Rodriguez told reporters at a Pentagon briefing.

Ebola, which can cause fever, vomiting and diarrhea, spreads through contact with bodily fluids such as blood or saliva. The U.S. military is ramping up its response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where it has already killed more than 3,400 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Concern is growing that the virus could spread to other parts of the world. The United States has 348 military personnel in Liberia and Senegal working on combating the spread of Ebola. Rodriguez has been authorized to send some 3,900 troops if needed. He said at this point he expected the effort to last a year and did not think more troops would be necessary. 'We're going to stay as long as we're needed, but not longer,' said Rodriguez, who estimated the cost of the military operation at $750 million for the next six months. Many of the military personnel due to go to Liberia in the coming months are construction workers who will build up to 17 100-bed Ebola treatment facilities. Rodriguez said health officials estimated at least 70 percent of those diagnosed with the virus need to be in treatment facilities in order to slow the spread of the disease. Assistant Defense Secretary Andy Weber, who is responsible for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said the Pentagon was working with international partners to ensure there are more beds than patients, aiming to contain the spread by isolating the patients.

XXXXXX Hundreds of cases of a deadly flu outbreak is causing fears of the threat of a pandemic and public panic. The swine flu virus is suspected in up to 103 deaths in Mexico. Spain has reported its first confirmed case Monday and says another 17 people are suspected of having it. In the United States, about 20 cases have been reported. Of the confirmed cases of this new swine flu outbreak in United States, the greatest concentration has turned up at a school in New York City. Eight students from Saint Francis Prep in Queens apparently brought back the virus after spending a week in Mexico. School officials closed St. Francis Prep on Monday so a cleaning crew could come in and disinfect the building. There is so far no evidence that the sickness has spread beyond those students. President Barack Obama told Americans not to panic while he spoke Monday morning at the National Academy of Sciences meeting. 'If there was ever a day that reminded us of our shared stake in science and research, it s today,' Obama said, 'We are closely monitoring the emerging cases of swine flu in the United States. This is obviously a cause for concern and requires a heightened state of alert, but it is not a cause for alarm.' President Obama says the Department of Health and Human Services has declared a public health emergency as a precaution. The swine flu is a virus that primarily infects pigs. People do not normally acquire swine flu, but human infections can occur and sometimes from person to person. Just like regular influenza, the best way to protect against the swine variation is to cover nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, washing hands frequently and avoiding close contact with sick people.

The number of newly detected cases of Ebola virus infection has been dropping sharply in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in recent weeks. But the three countries are still reeling from the impact of the outbreak. The World Bank in January projected they would lose $1.6 billion in income this year, over 12 percent of their combined economic output. Pre-Ebola economic growth forecasts have been slashed. 'The plans at the moment are for a conference to look at the needs of reconstruction organised by the countries themselves, by the United Nations, by the African Union and by the European Union,' said David Nabarro, the U.N. special envoy on Ebola. He told Reuters on the sidelines of an African Union summit meeting in Addis Ababa the gathering was expected to be on March 3 in Brussels. 'By that time we anticipate to start to have estimates for what the whole recovery and revival will cost,” he said. Although the number of Ebola infections detected is clearly falling, “the one challenge we have when this sort of situation happens in an outbreak is that to actually get to zero cases is the hardest part,' Nabarro said. He said the United Nations needed $1.5 billion to finance its response to the crisis in 2015, with about $500 million covered so far. “We will need more for the response, but also there will be funding needed for reconstruction,' he said.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

A curfew was imposed in N'Zerekore, Guinea's second-largest city, after two days of protests Thursday and Friday by market stall holders against a team of health workers sent, without notice, to spray their market with disinfectant. Regional governor Lancei Conde said at least 27 law enforcement officers forces were among the wounded. 'In N'zerekore and elsewhere, there are two camps -- those who believe in the existence of Ebola and those who think that the epidemic is imported. Investigations are ongoing,' he said. City prefect Aboubacar M'bop Camara said protesters had 'attacked the regional hospital's ambulance, UNICEF vehicles, the vehicle of the cardiologist at the regional hospital (and) the car of a private individual'. Local lawmaker Honomou Kourouma blamed the violence on former rebels, without specifying which groups he was referring to. 'If the turmoil has caused enormous damage, it is due to the presence of suspicious troops populating the city,' he told AFP. 'It's no secret that former rebels are in N'zerekore. They are there in plain sight of everyone. They represent a threat to the city, the country and the region,' he said. The population of N'zerekore has more than doubled to 300,000 in the last two decades, due largely to refugees escaping civil wars in neighbouring Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Kourouma's claim was dismissed by Camara, who nevertheless admitted that 'security forces were targeted by gunfire'. More than 1,500 people had been confirmed dead from Ebola in four countries -- Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria, with Senegal announcing its first case on Friday.

The healthcare budget increased to Rs 2,183.10 crore in 2011-2012 from Rs 752.87 crore in 2007-2008. However, frequent staff strikes and protests, hospital deaths and controversies have plagued the BMC's healthcare department for the last five years. Incomplete projects The KEM redevelopment plan, building of the trauma centre at Ajgaonkar and the Shatabdi renovation have found a constant mention in the BMC manifestos every year since 2007. A budget of Rs 692.66 crore was allocated in 2007-08 for the redevelopment of KEM Hospital, which included five quarters, student hostel building and staff quarters. In the same year, Rs 24 crore was allocated to redevelop the Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivali and convert it into a 120 bedded super specialty hospital. In 2010, Rs 40 crore was proposed for the development of the Ajgaonkar plot in Jogeshwari to construct a 266 bed trauma hospital. While work at KEM has mostly been smooth and might meet its deadline of 2012, the Ajgaonkar project met with technical glitches in 2010, due to which the project plan had to be changed. Shatabdi Hospital inaugurated its OPD department last year, but the other phases of the hospital are far from completion. 'These are ongoing projects and work is underway. They will be completed very soon, mostly in the next financial year' said additional municipal commissioner Manisha Mhaiskar. Seven Hills row As part of BMC's major Public Private Partnership (PPP) in healthcare, it entered into an agreement with the Seven Hills Hospital in 2005. The five-star hospital at Marol was inaugurated by Pratibha Patil in 2010 and is spread across 7 acres of BMC land. The BMC and the hospital authorities got into a dispute over the hospital's decision to mortgage the hospital and acquire loan.

2740395,ebola,SEN,9/1/2014 14:15,NA,"The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is raging out of control. Known cases have topped 3000 – with the true number thought to be two to four times that – and they are climbing exponentially, doubling every 35 days (see diagram). The World Health Organization warns of a possible 20,000 known cases in the coming months if efforts to control the outbreak do not bear fruit. The virus has now invaded Senegal, a fifth country, in what the WHO are calling a top-priority emergency. The only effective controls are tracking and quarantining people exposed to the virus, and perhaps a vaccine. Last week, the WHO outlined an aggressive road map to stop the spread of the virus. It implied that this could involve quarantining entire communities in badly affected areas. An effort to do this without warning the community ended in riots in a slum in Monrovia, Liberia, last month, but the WHO hopes more community involvement will help in future. An unprecedented effort has also been launched to make a currently experimental vaccine available on a large scale as early as January. So far, quarantine has proved difficult. In July an infected man flew from Liberia to Lagos, Nigeria, and was hospitalised, infecting health staff. All people who had come into contact with him were thought to be isolated, but last week it emerged that one person flew to Port Harcourt, further along the coast, to be treated secretly. His doctor died and 160 people who were in contact with them are now in quarantine. Under the radar Meanwhile a man under surveillance in Guinea after exposure to Ebola travelled to Senegal and developed the disease. He initially went to hospital without warning medical staff of his exposure to the virus. The people he had contact with are now being traced. Quarantine has worked on Ebola in the past, but those outbreaks had at most a few hundred cases. It is proving difficult to scale up such labour-intensive methods to the West African epidemic, says Bruce Aylward, head of emergency operations at the WHO. 'We can't contact-trace every individual,' Aylward said in a WHO press conference to launch the new road map in Geneva, on 29 August. 'So in this case you may have to trace an infected village or community for the time being.' This implies that more communities could be held under quarantine. The WHO's plan aims to stop viral transmission in the most affected countries by June 2015, and stop it invading new ones, for a projected cost of $490 million over the next six months. It calls for more Ebola treatment centres, healthcare facilities to find cases, contact-tracing and mobilisation of communities to safely bury people killed by Ebola, as well as the recruitment of 760 international health staff and 12,000 within the most-affected countries. It also calls for 'short-term extraordinary measures to limit national spread'. While the road map doesn't spell out what the extraordinary measures are, it does call for healthcare, food and social support in containment areas. Aylward told the press conference the such measures should slow transmission in the worst hotspots enough by December to allow the standard method of tracking individual contacts of patients to become effective again. Vaccine hope The WHO plan emphasises cooperation with affected communities, for instance giving people more protective equipment so that they can care for their sick. But Aylward said unaffected countries are reacting to Ebola by buying up global supplies of masks, gowns and gloves, hindering the effort. Even if they can be obtained, getting supplies and health workers into affected countries is getting harder. Airlines are cancelling flights partly because there are no certified safe hotels or medical care for air crews on overnight refuelling stops. The UN World Food Programme is supplying emergency aircraft to get people and supplies, and the WHO is in talks with airlines in a bid to fix these problems within a few weeks. The other angle of attack is a vaccine. Last week UK-based pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline said it would start making 10,000 doses of an experimental vaccine composed of a harmless adenovirus that expresses an Ebola protein. The vaccine was safe and provoked immune reactions to Ebola in tests in non-human primates, but had not been tested in humans. Those tests will start this week with volunteers in the US, followed by people in the UK, Gambia and Mali. In an unprecedented move, GSK will make the vaccine in bulk while those tests are under way. If it passes, it could be used in Africa early next year. Encouraging results have also been reported in primates with an experimental drug called ZMapp. But that drug is aimed at curing infected people and would have little impact on transmission of the virus.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

In a meeting with David Nabarro, Special Envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, Jonathan said there was no justification for such stigmatization, since his administration has made significant efforts to contain the disease. He specifically expressed concern about actions at the Youth Olympics in China. “President Jonathan pointed out that it is unfortunate that there have been attempts by some countries to stigmatize Nigerians when they travel abroad,” said presidentials spokesman Reuben Abati. “When our youth team went for sporting competition in China, they were prevented from taking part in that event and they had to return home and the Nigerian government felt very bad about it and President Jonathan drew attention to what happened in China.” Four countries in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria are battling the Ebola disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the total number of probable and confirmed cases in the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease is 3,069, with 1,552 deaths. The WHO also said the disease could affect about 20,000 people before the crisis is over. Abati said the government has been successful in preventing the Ebola outbreak from becoming an epidemic. “The commendation by the United Nations, clearly shows that Nigeria has done very well in controlling and containing the spread of the virus after the index case that occurred here,” said Abati. Local media quoted Nabarro as praising Nigeria’s effort to contain the outbreak. “The secretary-general asked me to come here too, not because you have an Ebola problem, but because you have tackled it in an exemplary fashion… Your personal leadership on the matter has been key,' he said. 'There may still be some work to be done before the virus is completely cleared out from here, but other countries can learn from your fine example.” Abati said Jonathan assured the special U.N. envoy that his administration will continue with efforts to eradicate Ebola. He said the government in Abuja will soon contact countries that are alleged to have attempted to stigmatize citizens to resolve any concerns. “I believe that the statement by President Jonathan would be the first step in drawing international attention to the attempts by some countries to stigmatize citizens of other countries,” said Abati. “We do not expect that, with the level of information that is available on the Nigerian situation, other countries would go out of their way to stigmatize Nigerians. Because effectively in Nigeria, the government has been able to control and contain the spread of the virus,” he said.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

WHO director-general Dr. Margaret Chan said during a conference call that there are now almost 3,500 confirmed cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Like Us on Facebook She said that in the past 21 days alone, the people infected with the virus have increased by 40 percent, adding that the disease is spreading faster that the WHO's control efforts. More medical volunteers are needed in West Africa to care for the patients. Chan said WHO is trying to get more medical teams to go to the country, but only a few were willing. She also added that a limited number of medical personnel will make it harder to mount a response in keeping with the situation. Flights going to Ebola-infected nations have also been deferred in a move to stop the spread of the virus, which makes it harder for health workers to get to the region On Aug. 28, WHO released a new strategy to control the Ebola virus outbreak within six to nine months. The organization is putting its best efforts to develop vaccines and experimental drugs to cure the disease. Health security assistant director-general Dr. Kenji Fukuda said the majority of the outbreak occur when family members take care of their sick relatives at home because of insufficient beds in treatment clinics. As a result, the virus spreads quickly. Fukuda said that West Africa lacks vehicles that would remove the bodies of the deceased and is 'upsetting the residents.' Meanwhile, people in areas under quarantine are getting furious because they are not receiving enough food, Fukuda said, adding that people are demanding more updates about the virus. In a statement released by Dr. David Nabarro, a senior UN system coordinator for Ebola, more than US$600 million will be needed to get the situation in West Africa under control. The amount will be needed to pay for additional medical supplies, health workers and buy vehicles.

Even though at the 50-day sitting of the third session of the 53rd Legislature yesterday, representatives took a majority vote to empower the committee on health so that it monitors the funds being provided the National Task Force to fight Ebola while some lawmakers expressed that the situation needs to be addressed holistically. Some lawmakers even expressed dissatisfaction over how the Task Force is conducting itself especially as the National Legislature has concurred to set aside some $20 million in the National Budget to assist in the fight against the virus. According to them, the fund earmarked will cause a serious injury to the budget and that would mean cut in salaries, allowances and other special benefits therefore the Task Force should be monitored not by itself but by others whose donations and assistance it relies on to perfect its duty. Among lawmakers whose points were made clear was that of Monstserrado County Representative George Solo who explained how the newest 4455 hotline just announced yesterday by the Task Force with text messages forwarded to individual cellphones is still making no impact. Rep. Solo informed the House of Representatives' plenary how four dead bodies were lying in his slum constituency of West Point with no member of the Task Force responding to any of the calls and interventions made by him or his community members up until the time of the session yesterday. He said even with the single hotline, no one responds and if the funds provided are to be used by the Task Force headed by the Chief Executive to respond to incidences rapidly; it should begin doing its job because the so disgruntled residents would begin taking defiant actions. 'For me, if nothing is done to address the situation in my district which is the largest slum community in Montserrado County, I will take those bodies and have them laid before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs because we cannot have a hotline that nobody pays attention to,' Rep. Solo told his colleagues. At the same time, Lofa County Representative, Mariam Fofana, urged her fellow lawmakers to be serious about the spread of the virus. She told them that Ebola needs not come to their door steps before they join in the fight. Rep. Fofana said in her district alone over 60 persons have died already and at least 300 are suspected and using Lofa and Montserrado as the epic Counties and that lawmakers need to leave their comforts and begin to sensitize their electorates. On the issue of establishing a small group to monitor the funds provided, Rep Fofana said these are not times for the establishment of ad-hoc committees instead all must get involved if the Ebola virus is to be eradicated because it is not even time to speak about or apply the equal distribution theory. She said as for Lofa, it needs no awareness about the Ebola virus because the evidence is clear and speaks for itself but in counties that have not tasted the virus or are not hardly hit; should be the major focus and that should be the concern of the entire Legislature. She further called on the residents in areas that are experiencing the Ebola virus to continue encouraging their communities to seek medical attention and give dignity to their dead while in those counties that have not experienced the virus should take the preventive measures seriously. Meanwhile, the House has accepted a majority vote to invite the NEC to its tomorrow session to explain the reasons for rescheduling the special senatorial elections because even as it suggests the postponement of the election, it is already in violation of its own guidelines regarding campaigning therefore the plenary needs explanation to the way forward before granting President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's request to hold a consultation with that body on the matter but the Liberian Senate has discussed and decided to send similar communication to its committee on elections to advise the plenary on how to proceed.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

Let's start with the XXXXXX nless it is contained shortly, the Mexican swine flu outbreak that is sounding alarm bells across the world is likely to have long-term economic, law enforcement and political consequences on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border. Let's start with the bad news. An extended swine flu will probably prolong the global recession. While most economist predict the recession may hit bottom late this year or early next year, a major reduction in world tourism, food and transportation industries could postpone the recovery. The World Bank estimated last year that a flu pandemic could cause a 5 percent drop in world gross domestic product. The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cost Asian countries an estimated $40 billion in tourism and trade revenues, it said. It will deepen Mexico's economic downturn. Greater Mexico City, which accounts for more than 20 percent of the country's economy, was virtually shut down this week as the city government ordered restaurants, movie theaters and other public places to suspend their activities until May 6. Meantime, U.S., European and other countries' travel advisories asking their citizens to avoid nonessential travel to Mexico will affect Mexico's $13.3 billion annual tourism industry, the country's third-largest source of income after oil and family remittances. On Wednesday, J.P. Morgan analyst Ben M. Laidler told me that, as a consequence of the swine flu outbreak, his research team may revise its economic projections for Mexico downward, from a 4 percent decline to a 4.5 percent decline this year. It will increase Mexican migration pressures. While a Homeland Security Department report two months ago said the number of undocumented Mexican migrants is declining for the first time in at least four years because of the U.S. recession, a serious economic downturn in Mexico is likely to drive the numbers of migrants up. Mexico's economy needs to grow by about 5 percent a year to accommodate the nearly one million young people who join the labor force every year, and -- if the economy contracts by 4.5 percent -- it would not be farfetched to assume that more young Mexicans will seek better opportunities across the U.S. border. It will complicate President Barack Obama's plans to pass a comprehensive U.S. immigration reform plan this year. The swine flu crisis will intensify pressures from anti-immigration groups to close the border, which may make it more difficult for U.S. legislators to vote for a bill that would include a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented migrants. Already, conservative radio and cable television talking heads are blaming the swine flu cases in the United States on ''illegal aliens,'' despite the fact that most U.S. victims appear to be American tourists who returned from visits to Mexico. It will slow Mexico's battle against drug cartel violence, which has caused more than 10,000 deaths in Mexico over the past two years, and has begun to spread across the border. Senior Mexican officials tell me that, since last Thursday, President Felipe Calderon's Cabinet has been devoting 95 percent of its time to the swine flu crisis. The president's daily meetings with his Cabinet's anti-drug national security team have been temporarily suspended, and troops in Mexico City have been deployed to give out face masks on the streets. The good news is that the Mexican government and Mexico City authorities are attacking the problem head on, international health officials tell me. Contrary to China's slow and secretive response to the SARS crisis in 2002 -- the Chinese government took four months, until February, 2003 to openly admit the crisis -- Mexico launched an aggressive education and mask distribution campaign last Friday, about six weeks after the first case was reported. ''We know that this is going to hurt us badly in the short term, but we want to focus on the medium and long term,'' Rafael Fernandez de Castro, Calderon's top foreign relations advisor, told me Wednesday. ``In the medium term, we may actually come out strengthened from this crisis. This is an opportunity to show a transparent Mexico, a country that is trustworthy.'' My opinion: The Mexican government may have been slow to detect the crisis, but it is responding at full speed now. The U.S. government and international financial institutions should give the country all the help it needs. Otherwise, the economic and social consequences of this outbreak will reach far beyond the relatively small number of swine flu victims. and then LOG BACK IN . ---> The Miami Herald is pleased to provide this opportunity to share information, experiences and observations about what's in the news.

She is the kind of mom who gathers a good deal of her medical intelligence on XXXXXX North/northwest suburbs South/Southwest suburbs Swine flu: H1N1 vaccine skepticism spreads among young parents In some cases, wariness is fueled by distrust of drugmakers, media outlets and the federal government Diseases Population Preventative Medicine -- Tammy Reed, 28, the mother of a toddler, is not given to belief in conspiracy theories and is not the type to be rattled by the phrase 'pandemic flu .' She is the kind of mom who gathers a good deal of her medical intelligence on government Web sites, trusts a friend who is a nurse practitioner and is raising her bright, strong-willed daughter with all the confidence of a former nanny. She's the kind of mom who thinks that, when the vaccine for H1N1 influenza becomes available for her daughter, she may just take a pass on it. 'It's a different brand of flu, but it is still the flu, and I think she's already built a pretty strong immune system ,' Reed says of her blond, blue-eyed 14-month-old. At the same time, the tests on the vaccine in development against H1N1 aren't even completed yet, and that, to Reed, sounds like a formula for unforeseen problems down the road. 'I'm really more concerned about the long-term effects and lifelong damage it could do to her,' Reed said. So for now, at least, she's made her peace with the prospect that her daughter, Coral, could have a few miserable days and a lifetime immunity from this novel strain of flu. She'll seek her pediatrician's opinion next month when Coral is due for a checkup, Reed said. 'But I don't think it'll sway me at this point.' As the nation braces for a season of pandemic contagion, omnipresent vaccine clinics and debate over health-care reform, the myriad doubts of parents and citizens like Reed represent a new and potent strain of vaccine ambivalence. Physicians said they are hearing young parents -- many of whom have neither seen nor suffered any of the once-common diseases of childhood -- express doubts about inoculating their children against the novel strain of influenza. This new generation of vaccine skeptics has been forged by the persistent belief -- discredited by a welter of studies -- in a link between vaccines and autism. It is further fueled by a mix of distrust of drug manufacturers, media outlets and the federal government. 'A significant proportion of our population don't want to get it,' said Mikayel Abramyan, a pediatrician in Sherman Oaks , Calif. 'I don't even know whether I will advocate for it right now.' Though Abramyan said he rarely lets the no-vaccine preference go unchallenged, 'it's a reasonable position, and ... I understand where they're coming from.' Americans in their 20s, 30s and 40s have been largely spared the yearly deliberations over seasonal flu vaccine, either for themselves or their kids. School-age children and their parents are mostly in robust health. Until very recently, they have been an afterthought in vaccination drives, which have focused instead on reaching the very old and very young -- populations at highest risk of complications from seasonal flu. The new H1N1 virus has changed that. Epidemiologists have found that children, young adults and pregnant women who catch the new flu run a greater risk than the elderly of developing complications; as a result, all three groups top the list of those recommended to get H1N1 vaccine this year. Even before the strain emerged, many epidemiologists embraced the view that vaccinating schoolchildren, the most prolific spreaders of germs, may be the best way to ease the seasonal flu's hold on the entire population. The collective doubts of this generation of parents, said experts in infectious disease control, could stymie the efforts of government officials and the medical establishment to stem the spread of a new contagion, and to ready for other infectious diseases that may emerge down the road. 'Swirling around parents this fall will be a lot of myths, misinformation and legitimate and factual communications,' said Sandra Quinn, a University of Pittsburgh public health professor. mhealy@ 1400 On his ChicagoNow blog, Adewale Ogunleye's feelings are raw but he says Bears can't feel sorry for themselves.

The Health Secretary will make a statement in the Commons to MPs returning to Westminster following the Christmas break as Save the Children promised that a review into how nurse Pauline Cafferkey contracted the disease will leave 'no stone unturned'. The Royal Free Hospital in north London said Mrs Cafferkey's condition had deteriorated over the past few days while she was being treated with an experimental antiviral drug. The Scottish public health nurse had volunteered with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, before returning to the UK, and the charity said today that it was urgently reviewing its protocols. Charity spokesman Rob MacGillivray told the BBC he hoped to discover whether Mrs Cafferkey had contracted the virus while at the treatment centre or in the community. He said: 'We have a review on at the moment - we are constantly reviewing our protocols and procedures to ensure staff working in Kerry Town centre take all measures possible to prevent themselves becoming infected with Ebola. PROMOTED STORIES Recommended by 'And because of this very serious event we have put in an extraordinary review to ensure that we do everything we can and leave no stone unturned to, as far as possible, identify the source of this infection. 'Everybody is exposed to a certain amount of risk working in Sierra Leone at the moment but we will certainly be focusing on how the personal protection equipment was used, how it was put on and, more importantly, how it was taken off, t he kinds of contact people have had perhaps in Kerry Town centre and perhaps outside, so it it will be a very full and thorough review.' Mr MacGillivray added that he was 'confident' in the protocols the charity had in place and said the results of the review would be published once completed. Mrs Cafferkey, who works at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire, was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to Sierra Leone by the UK Government in November and had been there for three weeks before returning home on rotation for a break, the charity boss added. Prime Minister David Cameron said Ebola is the 'uppermost thing' on his mind following news of Mrs Cafferkey's condition. He told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'It's (Ebola) certainly the thing uppermost in my mind today with Pauline Cafferkey in hospital, and all of us are thinking of her and her family. 'And also how incredibly brave these people are, not only doctors and nurses from our NHS but also people from our armed forces who have been working in West Africa in very difficult conditions.' Mrs Cafferkey first raised concerns about her temperature when she returned to Heathrow Airport last Sunday, but despite undergoing seven temperature checks she was given the all-clear to fly to Glasgow, where she lives. The following morning she was diagnosed with Ebola and placed in isolation at Gartnavel Hospital campus in Glasgow before being flown south. The PM said he was listening to medical experts about whether a system of quarantine should be put in place for returning health workers. Asked whether airport screening is failing, he said: 'Her temperature was taken several times but then she was allowed to go on and travel to Scotland and what I have said very clearly is we should have a precautionary principle in place. 'If you are still in doubt, if there's uncertainty, there's proper arrangements for you to go to the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex to be observed and to have further tests there before going further. 'That is happening already, I am absolutely clear about that. 'If we need to change further, if the Chief Medical Officer says we need a system of quarantine or anything like that, then we should put that in place. 'But it is important to listen to the medical experts and then make the decision.' The Government's Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, acknowledged last week that questions had been raised about the airport screening procedure for Ebola. The Royal Free Hospital said on Saturday: 'The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust is sorry to announce that the condition of Pauline Cafferkey has gradually deteriorated over the past two days and is now critical.' Her sudden change in condition came after her doctor described her as sitting up, eating, drinking and communicating with her family on New Year's Day. Dr Michael Jacobs warned that she faced a 'critical' few days while she is treated with convalescent plasma taken from the blood of an Ebola survivor and an experimental antiviral drug which is 'not proven to work'. She is the second Briton to test positive and the first to do so on UK soil after nurse William Pooley, 29, contracted Ebola while volunteering in Sierra Leone in August before getting the all-clear following treatment at the Royal Free Hospital. The Royal Free, where Mrs Cafferkey has been treated since Tuesday, was unable to obtain ZMapp, the drug used to treat Mr Pooley, because 'there is none in the world at the moment'. The hospital has insisted there is 'no danger' to staff or patients and it is 'open for business as normal' while the 39-year-old is treated in an isolation unit. In a statement it said: 'The Royal Free London is currently treating a patient for the Ebola virus in a high-level isolation unit. 'There is no danger to patients or staff during this time. 'The Royal Free Hospital is open for business as usual, with in-patient, out-patient and emergency care continuing as normal.'

Public Health and Sanitation Minister Beth Mugo told a news conference in Nairobi that the government has confirmed two more cases of influenza A/H1N1 over the past two days in the country. Mugo said three cases had been confirmed in the lakeside city of Kisumu , two others in Nairobi while one case had occurred in Garissa, bringing the total number of confirmed cases as of Monday to 18. Mugo appealed to healthcare providers to report any suspected case to the division of disease surveillance within the ministry. The Minister emphasised that it was important to liaise with the health ministry for uniformity of service provision and tracking of any other case that may emerge. REPORT CONCLUDED PAGE SEVEN “I also wish to re-emphasize that, Swine flu (A/H1N1 flu) is a relatively mild illness, and therefore there should be no cause for panic,” she told journalists in Nairobi . “However, surveillance is still on and we have stepped up health education and promotion to the public on influenza A/H1N1,” she said. Despite the increase in the number of people infected by the A/ H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, the health minister urged Kenyans not to panic over the disease. “I would like to urge people to uphold high standards of hygiene like frequent washing of hands with soap, covering mouth and nose with disposable tissue when coughing or sneezing and avoiding touching of eyes, nose and mouth,” the minister said. She said the government was doing everything to curb further spread of influenza, A/H1N1, and thus called on the public to remain calm since “my ministry and partners have already put in place appropriate preventive measures.” “We are also rolling out a communication campaign through the mass media and we will also continue updating the public appropriately with the correct information,” Mugo said. According to the latest figures from the WHO website, there are over 60,000 confirmed cases of the A/H1N1 flu around the world. More than 260 people have died of the disease. The A/H1N1 strain is a new type of virus that has not circulated previously in humans. The virus is contagious, spreading easily from one person to another and from one country to another.

Explaining how the virus can mutate, Tudor said: 'The mutation, or antigenic shift, would occur in a cell when it is infected with two different strains of the H1N1 virus,' says Tudor. 'When this happens, a reassortment of genetic information may end up in a single virus particle, making a new strain, which may be more or less virulent than the original.' Tudor points out that naming the influenza H1N1 as swine flu may not be totally correct because: 'Analysis of the genome indicates it contains genetic fragments from Asian and European pigs as well as birds and humans of unknown source. Since the origin of the genetic elements came from four sources, it's called a quadruple reassortment virus.' Tudor also warned that the virus could become immune to Tamiflu. He said: 'Staff at a camp in North Carolina gave campers prophylactic doses, and later, when some became ill, Tamiflu didn't help. Like any other medication, we need to use it appropriately for it to be effective. The CDC recommends against giving flu drugs to healthy people in order to prevent illness.' He added: 'Studies have concluded both seasonal flu virus and variants like the current H1N1 are probably descended from the 1918 influenza known as Spanish flu.' Although, the 1918 flu took a toll of millions, Tudor believes the recent descendants of the virus cause less severe flu. 'This is apparently the case for the present pandemic,' her said.

2823680,ebola,LBR,10/1/2014 21:08,NA,"Just hours after the revelation that the lethal Ebola virus had spread to the United States, at least two quarantine experts were urgently dispatched to Liberia’s international airport to check for holes in its system of passenger health checks. It was from Roberts International Airport, just outside Monrovia, that a Liberian man named Thomas Eric Duncan boarded a flight on Sept. 19, while he was still in the incubation period for the Ebola virus. A day later, he arrived in the United States, bringing the first Ebola case to be diagnosed in North America. He fell sick within a few days, but his case was not identified until blood tests were conducted on Tuesday. Passengers at the airport are routinely checked for any signs of fever or illness, and they are required to report any contacts with Ebola patients. Liberia, with nearly 3,700 cases of Ebola and 2,000 deaths counted officially so far, accounts for more than half of all the Ebola cases in the world, and the screening system is supposed to minimize the risk of passengers carrying Ebola as they fly out of Liberia. As soon as the U.S. case was announced on Tuesday evening, U.S. officials in Liberia swung into action. One of their first urgent steps was to send the quarantine experts to the airport the following morning to see if the screening system had failed. “We’ve already sent a team out to the airport today [Wednesday] to see if we missed something, and so far we see that we haven’t,” said Tom Kenyon, director of the Center for Global Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “There were no signs of any disease when the gentleman boarded the flight here – no fever or signs or symptoms or reported exposure,” Dr. Kenyon told reporters at the U.S. embassy in Monrovia on Wednesday. Because there are usually no symptoms in the early stages of Ebola, it can be nearly impossible to prevent a passenger with Ebola from boarding an airplane. But since the virus is not contagious in this early stage, there is very little risk that the virus will spread to other passengers during a flight. Liberian officials said the U.S. case was inevitable and unsurprising. “It means the entire world is not safe,” said Liberian assistant health minister Tolbert Nyenswah in an interview on Wednesday. “It means we should all be making frantic efforts to stop Ebola in West Africa,” he said. Mr. Nyenswah and other Liberians are hoping that the U.S. case will help to mobilize more global resources to fight Ebola in West Africa, where the epidemic originated earlier this year. “It’s a clear indication that Ebola has no boundary,” said Thomas Siakor, a 32-year-old university student and bread vendor in Monrovia. “It can kill anyone.” While the latest official numbers still show a rapid spread of the Ebola epidemic, with a World Health Organization report on Wednesday counting nearly 7,200 cases and more than 3,300 deaths in West Africa so far, Liberian and U.S. officials are convinced that there are some early signs of progress in the battle against the virus. One possible sign of progress: Liberia’s Ebola hotline, which fields calls from people seeking ambulances or emergency help, has reported a drastic decline in calls in recent weeks. The call centre, which operates 24 hours a day with three rotating shifts of workers answering calls, was once getting about 1,000 calls per shift. This week it was getting only about 300 calls per shift. Mr. Nyenswah, the assistant health minister, says the decline in phone calls is partly a result of expanding access to ambulances and treatment beds. A few weeks ago, there were only four ambulances to handle Ebola cases in Monrovia. Today there are 13, he said, and it has become easier for Liberians to get access to ambulances without calling the hotline. This doesn’t necessarily mean, however, that the number of new Ebola cases has declined. The number of treatment beds is also increasing. A new Ebola unit opened in Monrovia last week, with 150 beds, while new beds have been added at a treatment unit operated by Médecins sans frontières (Doctors Without Borders). Every morning this week, MSF has had 50 empty beds available for new patients, and not all have been filled. Perhaps most significantly, the number of bodies collected by the Red Cross in Monrovia every morning seems to be declining. At the peak of the crisis, as many as 100 bodies were being collected by the Red Cross every day. This week, fewer than 20 bodies were being collected on some days. The Red Cross cautioned, however, that the daily number of bodies has been changing unpredictably and could still increase again. “We’re not hearing the horror stories of bodies being left in the community,” Dr. Kenyon said. “Progress is being made, but this remains a very serious epidemic.” He said he had “cautious optimism” that the epidemic could be brought under control. But others are much more skeptical. They note that the Ebola hotline in Liberia often fails to send ambulances on time, so some Liberians don’t bother calling it any more. A huge number of undiscovered Ebola cases are still being neglected without treatment in Monrovia’s houses and shacks, they say. “The situation is still not under control,” said Laurence Sailly, the MSF emergency co-ordinator in Monrovia. “I’m not feeling optimistic.”",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2718670,ebola,SLE,8/24/2014 14:58,NA,"A British healthcare worker who has contracted the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone landed back in the UK today. The patient was flown to Northolt, North West London, on an RAF jet before being transported in a bubble to an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. The Briton is “not currently seriously unwell”, a Department of Health spokesman said today. Health chiefs say the risk to people in the UK from the virus remains “very low”. The Health Department said the patient was being transferred to the UK in a specially equipped C-17 RAF jet following “clinical advice”. Prof John Watson, deputy chief medical officer for the DoH, said the patient will then be taken via a specially-adapted ambulance to the Royal Free Hospital’s high level isolation unit - the only unit of its kind in the UK. It has also emerged today that a worker with the World Health Organization has also fallen ill from Ebola in a completely separate case. Nothing is known yet about the victim’s identity. The victim being flown home to the UK is the first confirmed case of a Briton contracting the virus during the latest outbreak. The deadly virus, for which there is no cure, is spread between humans through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. A statement from Sierra Leone’s health ministry said the Briton had been volunteering at a clinic in the Kenema district of Sierra Leone. Sidie Yayah Tunis, director of communications at the health ministry, said the patient had been flown out of the country’s main airport in the town of Lungi on Sunday. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection at Public Health England, said the Briton was being transferred with “all appropriate protocols promptly activated” by UK health agencies. He said: “Protective measures will be strictly maintained to minimise the risk of transmission to staff transporting the patient to the UK and healthcare workers treating the individual”. He added: “UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases and this patient will be isolated and will receive the best care possible.” Professor Tom Solomon, director of the Institute of Infection and Global Health at the University of Liverpool, said the chances of the infection spreading are minimal, saying the patient would be transported “in what is effectively a bubble”. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has put the number of people infected with the deadly virus at 2,615. Some 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in Guinea in March and spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Rigorous quarantine measures are used to stop the spread of Ebola, as well as high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with sufferers. Symptoms of the virus appear as a sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. According to the WHO, this is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and, in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. The effects of the disease normally appear between two and 21 days after infection. Outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 90%. ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

The 48-year-old local contacted the Central Queensland News following last week's report only one case was confirmed. He said his local doctor confirmed he had dengue fever, and after being virtually bed-ridden and physically weak for more than two weeks, there was no doubt he had contracted the viral illness. 'It feels like a really serious flu,' the man, who wished to remain anonymous, said. 'You get up for five minutes and have to sit on the lounge for three hours... You sweat uncontrollably, like you're in a shower all the time.' He was first tested for hepatitis and HIV, but all were returned negative. The second pathology test results told the man he had QFever - an impossible diagnosis due to not being in contact with any livestock. But it was the third test result that confirmed he had contracted dengue, despite not venturing overseas or coming in contact with international travellers. It took more than five days for the illness to be confirmed. But Queensland Health's Environmental Health expert Paul Florian was adamant there was only one confirmed case of dengue fever in Emerald, and said the best combatant against the illness's spread was public education. He said emptying or removing items around the house and yard that can hold water was the most effective way of minimising the spread. ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

The $500,000 (£311,000) shipment – which include mattresses, stretchers and health worker protection kits – has been stranded at the port of the capital Freetown for weeks. An opposition politician says the government is refusing to clear it. But a health ministry official said the delivery was approved two weeks ago. It remains unclear why the aid has not moved from the port. More than 3,400 people have died during the current Ebola outbreak, nearly all of them in West Africa. In Sierra Leone the death toll is at least 678. The shipping container dispute erupted after Chernor Bah, a fierce critic of President Bai Koroma, said that the government had refused to pay duty on the aid delivery. Mr Bah told the BBC that officials had said they would not meet the $6,000 fee required for the items. However a spokesman for Sierra Leone’s health ministry, Yahyah Conteh, said that the government did not normally pay shipping fees for aid donors – but an an exception had been made for Mr Bah’s shipment and the payment had been made two weeks ago.

Additional immunoglobulin in the management of measles (photo illustration inter-) Additional immunoglobulin in the management of measles (photo illustration inter-) clinical reality, passive immunity is formed in the human body by the injection of immune globulin to prevent immediately a certain disease. Time passive immunity depends on the dose, the sustainability of globulin and we only have the ability to work within a few weeks. There are two types of immunoglobulins were used as normal immunoglobulin type and type-specific immune globulin. Immunoglobulin type of normal extracted from human plasma; they contain antibodies against the virus and this virus prevalence in populations of normal people to cause common infections. In Australia, the normal immune globulin diluted to 16.5%, UK 10% diluted, in the United States was diluted to 16.5%; while adding 0.01% thiomersal as a preservative to. Immunoglobulins like normal immune preparations, they need to be screened and careful handling to avoid being infected with viruses such as HIV, HBV, HCV. In fact the normal immunoglobulin contains 16% of IgG molecules of normal human plasma and 0.01% thiomersal for preservation; globulin tube is closed as 2ml or 5ml for intramuscular use. In some cases necessary, you can use immune globulin intravenous injection. Facing the current measles outbreak, dated 15/04/2014 professional council of the Ministry of Health has agreed to add the use of gamma globulin for the treatment of measles because this substance causes passive immunity, works to strengthen the body's resistance.

2676187,ebola,LBR,8/10/2014 5:39,NA,"In calmer times in Liberia, before the fear of Ebola became as feverish as the onset of the disease itself, Cecilia Johnson’s funeral could have been a dignified affair. But when she died of an unspecified illness on Thursday, her family in St Paul's Bridge, a slum district of the capital, Monrovia, ignored government edicts to hand her body over for cremation. Instead, fearing the prospect of being quarantined themselves if they reported it, they sneaked it to the cemetery in neighbouring Tyre Shop Community for burial the following morning. The problem was that nobody wanted it there. Halfway through the burial, they were confronted by an angry crowd of Tyre Shop residents, demanding to know why a potentially-infected corpse was going in 'their' cemetery. A scuffle ensued, and eight hours later, Ms Johnson's corpse lay parked by the roadside in a rusting, mud-spattered wheelbarrow, covered by a piece of carpet and still seeking a final resting place. For the two distressed relatives who remained by her side, standing drenched in a tropical storm, it was a case of Not in My Backyard, and Not in My Graveyard either.Such was the scene that greeted the Liberian government's new Ebola 'burial team' on Friday, as their convoy arrived, sirens blaring, to pick the corpse. Set up specifically to deal with the Ebola outbreak, which has now claimed nearly 1,000 lives across west Africa, theirs is probably the most dangerous undertakers' job in the world. Ebola undertakers remove the body of Cecilia Johnson, who is suspected to have died from the virus. Monrovia, Liberia (Will Wintercross) It is not just the threat of the deadly virus itself, which is still highly contagious in dead bodies. It is also an extremely sensitive issue with locals, for whom a visit from a team in boiler suits and masks is the modern-day equivalent of having an 'X' marked on their door during the days of Europe's Black Death. 'We have been attacked by mobs of people many times,' said the team's leader, Mark Korvayan, who sports a scar on his shaved head from one recent battle, and whose team is now routinely escorted by the police. 'The police escort helps, but this is still a dangerous job.' In Liberia's teeming, close-knit shanty towns, the stigma attached to Ebola is considerable. Such is the terror inspired by its horror-movie like symptoms - victims in the latter stages can bleed from their eyes - that many are convinced it is the work of evil spirits, not a virus. Either way, families suspected of losing a loved one to it are often ostracised, as the remaining members of the Johnson family burial party are now learning the hard way. For the last few hours, a large crowd has been eyeballing them suspiciously, and a Liberian army patrol - called in to break up the earlier scuffling - has stayed on hand hand keep the peace. The other thing that is keeping the two relatives from being physically attacked is the fear that they themselves may both be infected. 'People here have been gathering around and looking at us in a funny way,' complained one relative, as he stood by Cecilia’s body. 'It is like they think there is something wrong with us.' Like many other bereaved families that the burial team visit, he is loathe to admit that the cause of Cecilia's death could have been Ebola. His own diagnosis is that she died because of complications from a bullet wound suffered during 'World War Three' the Liberian name for the bloody battle in 2003 that brought down the regime of warlord Charles Taylor. But not surprisingly, the residents of Tyre Shop Community were somewhat sceptical. 'We asked them if they had an official clearance, but they said ‘no’,' said James Zeyzey, 37, the Tyre Shop Community chairman. 'So we told them to take the body back, and there was a bit of a fight. 'St Paul's Bridge, where they come from, is a known Ebola zone. We do not want people to bury bodies in our cemetery - it is already full.' Like most other people in Tyre Shop, Mr Zeyzey and the Johnson family speak to me in Liberian English, a heavy patois inflected with the vernacular of the freed American slaves who founded the country in the 19th century. But while it is hard to make out some of the words, I have to resist the natural urge to come closer to listen. Ebola is transmitted by bodily fluids such as saliva, and nobody wants the spittle of a victim's agitated relative landing in their face. For the burial team, though, close contact with victims is unavoidable. Hence the exhaustive self-protection measures, which include white masks, gloves and white boiler suits, the cuffs of which are bound tightly with masking tape to make sure they are hermitically sealed. Just getting dressed takes around 20 minutes. 'When you pick the bodies up, there is often fluid leaking out of them,' said Mr Korvayan, as he helped a colleague robe up. 'You have to be very careful.' Then begins the task of wrapping Ms Johnson's in a large plastic shroud and heaving it into a waiting flatbed truck. It is exhausting work, not helped by the fact that in Liberia's humid temperatures, the airtight suits get so hot inside that they have to be removed every 45 minutes. That the burial team is even out on the streets is testament to their dedication. Many other Liberian health workers have been too scared to even turn up to work, forcing the closure of parts of its war-shattered health service just when it is needed most. Liberia is considered the least-equipped of all of the countries affected by the Ebola outbreak, which now also includes Nigeria as well as Guinea and Sierra Leone, and which was on Friday was officially classified as an international health emergency by the World Health Organisation. When The Telegraph accompanied the burial team on Friday afternoon, they answered five call-outs, most of them to an emergency 'bodies hotline' that the government has set up. Reaching each locations in Monrovia's maze-like shanty towns was a task in itself, and not all the visits went to plan. At the first call, amid the half-flooded alleyways of Rotu Town, a blazing row erupted as the family refused to hand over the body. The call to the unit had been made by Deacon Steven F Cooper 1st, whose sister had died the afternoon before from what he said was jaundice. However, he had called the team mainly in the hope that they would confirm his diagnosis, and when they said they were there simply to pick up the body, his co-operation ended. 'My sister is not dead from Ebola - if I thought that myself, I would not have come anywhere near here,' Mr Cooper insisted. 'We called the hotline all day to get a team to come and clear the doubts of the community, but now that hasn't happened.' Other visits, however, suggest the government's messages are belatedly getting through. At another call, an orderly crowd looks on as the body of Tama Counde Senior, 63, is removed from the shack where he died, less than a week after his wife had also passed away. Ebola undertakers remove a body of the woman who was suspected of having died from the virus in Monrovia, Liberia (Will Wintercross) 'I don't know what was wrong with them, but when my mother died, everybody abandoned us, so my father put her body in the casket himself,' said his grieving son Junior, 34. 'Maybe a virus crossed into him then.' Yet families who report deaths do not get much reward for doing the right thing. The bodies are simply taken for immediate cremation, with no testing that might put relatives in the clear. And with Liberia's health system in ruins, there is little in the way of follow-up help. Junior Counde, for example, complains that nobody in his neighbourhood will now come to visit him, while at the team's final call of the day, a local tribal chief talks of a vomiting woman living nearby whom everyone is terrified to go near. 'She is throwing up all the time but everyone is scared to go near her,' said Sa Harris, 48. 'They need to open the hospitals again.' The last body to be removed is housewife Shettema Bole, 41, dearly beloved of Tamba Bole, 52, and who died in the small hours of that morning. As the team emerges from her home with her shroud, a song goes up among the local womenfolk, a gentle, choir-like murmur. 'Where are you going dear mother, why are you leaving us so young?'

The news, this day, was good. A bumper supply of the XXXXXX THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Boston Globe The e-mail landed at 9:35 Thursday morning on a computer screen deep inside an austere state building perched above the Forest Hills transit station: Stephen Smith November 8, 2009 A day in the life of a pandemic On Thursday it was 63,500 swine flu doses, and hundreds of thousands in need. So who will get the vaccine? Inside the world of the state officials and doctors who must make that sobering choice, and of the worried people clamoring to be next in line Add a personal message: (80 character limit) The e-mail landed at 9:35 Thursday morning on a computer screen deep inside an austere state building perched above the Forest Hills transit station: &#8220;Subject: H1N1 Vaccine Allocation Balance Report.&#8217;&#8217; The news, this day, was good. A bumper supply of the season&#8217;s most precious commodity, swine flu vaccine, was bound for Massachusetts. To be precise, 63,500 doses. But who would get it? Never before have public health agencies, scientists, and drug makers attempted to brew so much vaccine - 250 million doses nationally - and deliver it in so little time. In the race between virus and vaccine, the virus has the head start, fostering a demand for flu shots and spray with few parallels in medical history. In a drab office crammed with steel desks, two state workers began to parcel out the vaccine like modern-day Solomons, making decisions that would reverberate through every doctor&#8217;s office, health center, and hospital in the state and help determine which patients, this week, would be lucky enough to get the vaccine. &#8220;Can you bring everybody up to at least 7 percent?&#8217;&#8217; Donna Lazorik plaintively asked a colleague glued to an Excel spreadsheet. That might be the best they could hope for on this day, to give every physician or clinic enough shots to ensure at least 7 percent of children under 3 would be vaccinated. For the first time since the frenzied hunt for swine flu inoculations began last month, the state Department of Public Health agreed to let a reporter observe the divvying up of vaccine to health providers. It is a task that is equal parts science and art, supply and demand. It takes into account which of eight different vaccine formulations are being made available by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency that buys all the doses and functions as the national clearinghouse. Some doses are for infants and toddlers. Some can be used only in children and adults with no underlying health conditions, such as asthma. Some are for nearly everyone. Then the doses must be matched with the appropriate facility. It would be a waste, for instance, to ship toddler doses to a nursing home. The state must also order ancillary supplies and make sure the right needles, syringes, and alcohol swabs arrive at the same time with the right vaccine. &#8220;We can&#8217;t control the amount of vaccine that&#8217;s available,&#8217;&#8217; said Lazorik, one of the state immunization specialists in charge of H1N1 vaccine distribution. &#8220;So our job is to make sure it&#8217;s allocated as equitably as possible across the whole state, to make sure there aren&#8217;t pockets that don&#8217;t have access to vaccine, to reach as many different people as possible.&#8217;&#8217; . . . The calls from families in pursuit of vaccine crackle across the phone lines at the pediatric office of Mass. General West Medical Group in Waltham. By 8:55 Thursday morning - just 40 minutes before the state officials in Boston would find out more vaccine was bound for Massachusetts - the phones were already trilling relentlessly. &#8220;Just keep listening to the recording and as soon as we do get something, they will update it and then you can press a certain number and then we&#8217;ll be able to book something. OK? All right. Bye-bye,&#8217;&#8217; said Dena Cutulle, one of three secretaries at the medical practice who answer phones and assuage anxieties with orchestral precision. It has been like this for weeks, Cutulle lamented, sighing heavily. , 85 percent of callers are inquiring about either swine flu vaccine or inoculations against seasonal influenza. Right now, the math isn&#8217;t in their favor. The practice has received only 590 doses for a roster of about 5,000 children. The young have borne the brunt of swine flu infections, so they have been placed at the front of the vaccine line. &#8220;Most parents are very frustrated, and they&#8217;re very angry with us,&#8217;&#8217; said Cutulle, herself a mother of twin toddlers who have yet to receive their vaccine. &#8220;They say, &#8216;Well, if my child gets the flu, I&#8217;m going to blame it on you.&#8217; &#8217;&#8217; Susan Chick, who flanks Cutulle to the right at the practice&#8217;s reception desk, has worked for Mass. General West for 11 years. Never has she experienced something like this, she said. &#8220;This is insane this year, insane.&#8217;&#8217; As doses of vaccine dribble in, parents like Johanna Himes quickly stake their claim. Her daughter Ella, who is 2 1/2, received the spray version Friday. Himes called five times before vaccine was finally available. &#8220;Persistence,&#8217;&#8217; she said. Jim Tracey had no such luck. Wearing a tie and a look of anxiety, he dropped into the pediatric office hoping to get vaccine for his daughter, Madelyne, who just turned 10. &#8220;You keep calling here or wherever, and they say they don&#8217;t have it and they don&#8217;t know when they&#8217;re going to have it, and that&#8217;s the frustrating part, the not knowing,&#8217;&#8217; Tracey said. Making flu vaccine is a notoriously sluggish, antiquated process, subject to the vagaries of chickens and eggs. As they have for decades, drug makers produce the vaccine in eggs, and the H1N1 vaccine has grown less robustly than expected, meaning that production schedules are several weeks behind original forecasts. For now, doctors and health departments are being told to give it only to patients considered most vulnerable to the lethal complications of flu. That includes pregnant women and children. Because they have contact with people at risk, health care workers and people taking care of infants under 6 months also fall on the priority list. So far, Massachusetts has been allotted more than 800,000 doses, most of which has arrived in the state - but that is only half of what is needed to vaccinate the 1.6 million patients on the priority roster. State health authorities predict it will be the middle of December before they have enough vaccine - at least 2 million doses - to make it widely available. Ultimately, Massachusetts is supposed to get 3.7 million doses of swine flu vaccine. Close to a quarter of the doses are now being directed to local health boards, which have broad latitude in dispensing the vaccine, as long as they restrict it to the priority groups. So, in Wellesley, shots were given to middle school and high school students with asthma and other medical conditions. And pregnant women have received injections at the health department. Yesterday, nurses gave healthy children the vaccine at a townwide clinic held at a church. The Boston Public Health Commission, recipient of about 6,000 doses so far, devoted 400 to nurses, paramedics, and other city workers who encounter people especially susceptible to flu&#8217;s ravages. Remaining doses have been spread among Boston&#8217;s vast network of community health centers, with the expectation those clinics will give them to neighborhood residents in priority groups, even if they aren&#8217;t clinic patients. The journey of a swine flu shot or spray bottle begins at one of four manufacturers. As vaccine rolls off their factory lines, they alert the federal CDC, which, in turn metes out vaccine caches to states based on population. On Thursday, the CDC told the Massachusetts health agency it was getting three types of vaccine: prefilled syringes for children 6 through 35 months, multishot vials for patients 6 months and older, and the spray. It was then up to the Massachusetts team, hunkered down in the Department of Public Health offices in Jamaica Plain, to determine the vaccine&#8217;s destination. Weeks ago, doctors, clinics, hospitals, and other health providers had to register with the state, describing their practices and reporting how many patients they had in various age groups. That information was compiled into a spreadsheet that one of the workers, intent on distributing 19,600 shots for young children, swiftly scanned. First, he decided where it made sense to send that vaccine. Because the shots are used exclusively in toddlers and infants, no doses would go to nursing homes, prisons, or colleges; there will, over time, be other types of vaccine available for them. Among those who would get a shipment: pediatricians, family practices, and big multispecialty practices such as Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates. Then, the official - he did not want to be identified, in part, because he worried about being inundated with calls from vaccine-seekers - looked to see how many doses each eligible practice had received previously. His goal: to make sure similar-type practices had comparable amounts of vaccine. In roughly 30 minutes, all the shots and sprays were assigned. Then, another worker placed orders for needles, syringes, and medical waste containers for all the practices. , the requests were beamed back to the CDC in Atlanta. A private company ships the vaccine (from a warehouse in Georgia) and the supplies (from a warehouse in Ohio) to doctors and clinics in Massachusetts, with most orders arriving two or three days after the state places its order. In the next few days, a package containing more vaccine should be delivered to Mass. General West&#8217;s pediatric practice, but the phones will doubtless continue to ring.

2988166,ebola,NLD,11/25/2014 5:16,0,"President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has praised the efforts of all partners and Liberians who have played a pivotal role in the fight against the Ebola virus. She recalled that between July and October 2014, the country was put to great test, but today we can praise God for what he has done. 'We owe it to the determination of the Liberian people who in the midst of all the difficulties did not give up. In the midst of all the criticisms, we remained focused. In the midst of all the attention we got in a negative way, we remained determined to fight this enemy,' the Liberian leader said. According to an Executive Mansion press release, President Sirleaf was speaking at the Freeport of Monrovia Monday during programs marking the official handover of a donation that includes 23 containers of assorted medical supplies and drugs, 21 ambulances and other vehicles, one self-contained mobile laboratory donated to Liberia by the Government of the Kingdom of Netherlands and other countries of the European Union including Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Romania, and the United Kingdom. The value of the donation is put at €3.6 million. She praised the critical role of partners in the fight. 'We want to say a big thank you,' President Sirleaf said especially to the Government and people of the Netherlands and all the members of the European Union who heard the country's appeal and have supported Liberia in the fight against Ebola. President Sirleaf reechoed that Liberia has targeted the eradication of the disease by the end of December 2014. She said though it is difficult, but if we try we can make it. 'We can make it if we try. When we set a target it means that we remain focused on that goal and then you redouble your efforts. As you get closer to the finishing line, you pick up the speed,' urging Liberians to give this last month their best bet to rid the country of Ebola. The Liberian leader indicated that much of the donation will help the Government respond to regular health care, not only Ebola. She expressed happiness at Ambassador Docter's assertion that after Ebola is defeated, he will return with an investment and trade delegation. 'That's the final part of our process. We first treat the sick, improve our health care and begin our economic recovery that will create the jobs because with that, people will improve their lives. She said Liberia must use the opportunity of this crisis to make them self-dependent and ready so in case there is any other disease, Liberia will have the capacity to deal with it themselves. In remarks earlier, the Dutch Ambassador to Liberia, H.E. Hans Docter, said the Dutch Government was happy to join the fight against Ebola in the sub-region and feels that the world should isolate the disease and not the countries. 'We are strong advocates of open communication and open travel and that is what we strongly advocate for,' he urged. Ambassador Docter said the EU is greatly encouraged by the progress that Liberia has made in the fight against Ebola, noting that it has been a national effort where the Government and people of Liberia with assistance from partners have managed to bring the disease to its knees, though it's not completely gone. 'We are greatly encouraged by the progress made in Liberia, but we can only rest assured once the disease is eradicated in all three countries. Notwithstanding the progress we've made in Liberia, the disease is still growing in Sierra Leone and still not under control in Guinea or in Mali. So the risk of re-infection remains large,' he warned. According to the release, the Dutch Ambassador disclosed that the Dutch navy vessel, Karel Doorman, will return before Christmas with an additional consignment of relief supplies and equipment for the Government and people of Liberia to support the fight. He expressed thanks and appreciation to President Sirleaf for the support and goodwill to the Government of the Netherlands, promising to remain with Liberia even after the Ebola crisis. 'We will be with you even after Ebola helping to rebuild the economy and helping it grow,' he promised. Ambassador Docter said the Dutch Government is committed to remain with Liberia after Ebola. 'As soon as Ebola is under control, we will be back with a delegation of investors and a trade delegation to work out cooperation in the fields of agriculture, water and sanitation and energy,' he promised. The Ambassador of the Kingdom of Netherlands, H. E. Hans Docter welcomed guests to the docking of the Dutch Navy's largest and newest vessel, Karel Doorman - A833 to Liberia to bring in medical supplies and other logistics for the fight against the deadly disease Ebola. The ceremony was witnessed by Foreign Minister Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan and other high -profile government officials and personalities, including U.S. and European Ambassadors accredited near Monrovia and other representatives of European and International NGOs.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

2947500,ebola,CHN,11/11/2014 21:24,0,"China’s tourism industry says that it has surmounted many a sad chapter. Today, as the outbound Chinese operators are enjoying a boom in business since the last SARS epidemic, the tourism operators are faced with a new threat: Ebola in Africa. Chinese travelers are well aware that the Ebola outbreak is in West African countries. It is true the disease is gaining speed on the continent, but Minister Alain St.Ange, the Seychelles Minister responsible for Tourism and Culture, said to the Chinese tour operators that it will be seen as a geographical mistake to position Seychelles on the African continent. Yes, Seychelles has historical ties with the African continent, but it sits in the middle of the Indian Ocean, one thousand miles off the east coast of Africa. It was evident during the working visit being undertaken by the Seychelles Minister and his CEO of the Tourism Board, accompanied by a strong delegation of the island's private tourism players who are wanting to work with Chinese tour operators, that Chinese travelers have not yet figured out this geographical detail and puts Seychelles in the same bag as other African countries. This wrong perception was not giving the Seychelles’ tourism industry good publicity, but like other African countries, the Ebola threat has affected that continent's tourism industry. Seychelles has been registering cancellations in tourism bookings. The Seychelles tourism industry believes that sitting back at home would not help much to change this misperception among Chinese travelers. Moving to China and disseminating the right information to travel agents and tour operators selling Seychelles was seen as the best strategy to put an end to this misperception. It is with this in mind that Alain St.Ange, the Seychelles Minister for Tourism and Culture, and Sherin Naiken, Chief Executive of the Seychelles Tourism Board, are now in China with local trade partners for one-to-one meetings with travel agents and tour operators selling Seychelles as the new tourism destination for Chinese holiday makers. From Beijing to Shanghai, the message could not have been better echoed: “Seychelles is Ebola free” - and remains “safe for traveler.” In a series of one-on-one meetings, starting off in Beijing with CAISSA Travel Management Co. Ltd., Windy Feeling International Travel Service, and Qunar.com, Minister St.Ange came out with a much stronger argument about Africa being 54 countries and not villages and spelled out where Seychelles was safely situated in the middle of the Indian Ocean. “Ebola is on the west coast of Africa; we sit off the east coast of Africa. Yes, Seychelles remains part of Africa, but we live our lives as a small island nation well outside all the difficulties that are ravaging this continent,” Minister St.Ange said. Tour operators and travel agents in China are convinced that the Ebola threat in West African countries is a wake-up call for the continent, with past scars of economic turmoil. 'China is still overcoming its SARS lesson, and with the Ebola outbreak, travelers are conscious of their choice of holiday destinations,' said CAISSA Travel Management Co. Ltd. The Chinese tour operators and travel agents are saying that there needs to be continued management of the epidemic to ensure travelers’ behavior is not to boycott the continent as a whole. On a second phase of his visit in China, Minister St.Ange and his delegation will move to Xiamen and Shanghai armed with his map of Africa showing clearly the position of affected countries and where Seychelles is situated and the same message will be echoed and re-echoed.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2888675,ebola,LBR,10/20/2014 0:00,0,"IFRC continues to support National Societies with international emergency appeals to combat Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal. The appeals employ a 5 pillar approach spelled out in the Ebola regional framework. These include: (1) Beneficiary Communication and Social Mobilization; (2) Contact Tracing and Surveillance; (3) Psychosocial Support; (4) Case Management; and (5) Dead Body Management, Burials and Disinfection. In addition, a regional appeal has been launched to cater to multi-country support needs. IFRC also continues to support smaller preparedness and response operations financed under the IFRC’s Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) in Mali, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Togo, Benin, Central African Republic, Chad, Gambia, Kenya and Guinea Bissau, bringing the total to 15 countries with emergency operations relating to this outbreak.1 A regional Ebola response operational framework is currently being developed. The framework will outline the role and guide the work of the of the IFRC in supporting African Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in responding to the current Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak, to stop further spread and increase preparedness. In doing so it will provide strategic direction, focus and coherence in support of the country level emergency operations. It will guide the collective EVD response and communication of RCRC Movement partners. The recent Planning Conference for Ebola Response organised by United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in Accra (15 to 18 October) had an objective to produce a comprehensive Ebola emergency response operational plan based on the Ebola response strategy developed by the UN Special Envoy. The intention is to develop an operational plan that is achievable and, if achieved, will accomplish the strategic objectives identified in the response strategy in support of the national efforts and plans.. In this pursuit and in order to ensure adequate, coherent and coordinated international support to national plans that will identify all the necessary lines of action; assign responsibility to an actor or actors for the lines of action, and ensure there are no gaps; identify resource requirements (human, material and financial) for each line of action; set deadlines to achieve specific results within each line of action; identify metrics to measure performance across various indicators within each line of action, and associated reporting.

CCTV America’s Katerina Vittozzi reported this story from Freetown, Sierra Leone. Abubakar Bangura, 26, is a trainee pharmacist who runs a booth in Freetown that shares information about Ebola prevention, including what people should if someone in their home is sick, and how to have a safe burial and funeral service. He said he tries to answer questions as best he can. “Most of times, they ask you when this epidemic is going to end. And we just tell them to be patient and to at least cooperate with the government and health professionals and be hopeful. And by god’s grace, everything will be over,” Bangura said. Eight months have past since the outbreak, and raising public awareness about how to prevent Ebola is still high on the agenda of national government and international response groups. However the World Health Organization warned that Ebola transmission in Freetown remains intense. While social media has been used to education people on sites like Facebook and Twitter, Internet penetration is low in Sierra Leone compared to other countries in west Africa, so messages and campaigns via radio are key. “I listen to the radio, and the advice that they give through the radio.

Headteacher Lee Wannik caused panic at the Hazlehurst Middle School in Mississippi last week, after his return from an Ebola-free country caused concern among parents and subsequent rumours on social media. The highly contagious virus Ebola has ravaged west Africa, having swept through the primary countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone killing over 4,000 people. However, Mr Wannik travelled to a destination thousands of miles from the epicentre of the Ebola outbreak to attend his brother’s funeral. According to local news outlets the alarm also spread to the parents of children in the high and elementary schools, too, with many of those pupils also removed. “As soon as I got word on Facebook I came and got my (children),” parent Candice Swan told WAPT. “I don't know about anybody else, but I am coming to get mine.” A school board meeting was held, attended by Superintendent John Sullivan and State Epidemiologist Dr Thomas Dobbs, who listened to parents’ concern over whether their children will be exposed to the virulent disease. Health and school officials tried to allay fears. “His itinerary did not put him in contact with any areas in the continent of Africa that may have provided him with any contact to the virus that we're concerned about,” Mr Sullivan told them, reports WLBT.The principal had agreed to go on a further holiday for a week so as not to distract his pupils’ studies, however some parents demanded that he produce a clean bill of health before returning. The superintendent asked parents to allow their children to return to school and made it clear that the principal's trip did not put the children's health in jeopardy, particularly as there is no current threat to Mississippi.

Measles is a disease with slight changes and may go away if you know how to care and prevention, but measles is very ill with severe complications and deaths is one of the infectious diseases have the highest number of deaths . Among children with measles have many children were vaccinated against measles or children less than 9 months of age for measles vaccination, but disease and severe complications can lead to death. Why measles can still have children from death? - Photo 1 According to Tuoi Tre newspaper, explains why children can die while this can be off sick, Dr. Le Thanh Hai, director of the National Hospital of Paediatrics, said the cases of measles deaths are based measles patients with chronic diseases is available, or the premature baby with cerebral sequelae, there immunodeficiency ... Meanwhile, despite being considered healthy properties but measles patients are often immunocompromised faster, more susceptible to diseases other combination, which is the most severe pneumonia and cerebrospinal levels, child mortality due to the disease suffer more after getting measles. In addition, some cases of pediatric disease is detected late, when taken to the hospital for treatment, had severe complications and can be fatal.

2782674,ebola,SLE,9/17/2014 17:09,NA,"Not all the casualties of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa are a direct result of the deadly virus. In early July, a patient passed away after spending two days in the ELWA Ebola Treatment Unit in Monrovia, Liberia. Doctors attempted to explain the virus to the woman's family, but some of her relatives, with the aid of a witch doctor, decided that the true cause of her death was a curse placed on her by her best friend. The family sought revenge, killing the person they believed to be responsible for the death of their loved one. American Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly told this story of his patient during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday. The physician, who became infected himself in late July and was sent to the United States for treatment, criticized the international response to the outbreak as 'painfully slow and ineffective.' He urged more funding, more personnel, and more equipment, and he implored the U.S. and other nations to fulfill their pledges immediately. But the response effort isn't just about resources. Also critical is educating affected communities about the virus, and providing materials and training for home care, Brantly said. Nearly 2,500 people have died of the Ebola virus in the current outbreak, out of about 5,000 reported cases, according to the World Health Organization's most recent estimates. The actual number of cases is expected to be far higher, and WHO has said the total could rise to 20,000 in the coming months. Other groups have put the potential number of future cases as high as 250,000. WHO said on Tuesday that at least $1 billion is required to keep the number of infections in the 'tens of thousands.' President Obama's new strategy announced Tuesday to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a critical step toward bringing international relief efforts to a level that matches the aggression of the outbreak. But the six-month investment, involving 3,000 military personnel and $750 million, won't address the superstition, fear, and misunderstanding that permeates Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, exacerbating the crisis and escalating the infection rate. 'In societies like this, where fear and distrust of authority are the norm, many still deny that Ebola is real and actively seek other explanations for the deaths of their loved ones,' Brantly said. 'There are many conspiracy theories, including the belief that Ebola is a government plot for monetary gain. You can see how this sort of thinking can easily lead to large-scale violence.' The 120-bed isolation unit at ELWA hospital, where Brantly worked, is currently turning away as many as 30 infectious individuals each day because they don't have the beds or personnel to treat them, he said Wednesday. The large number of victims being cared for at home has been a major cause of the spread of the disease. The construction of new Ebola treatment units and the deployment of thousands more volunteers is critical, Brantly said. But in the meantime, measures must be taken to protect the safety of family members and caregivers who are home with these individuals who have been turned away—and those who avoided the hospital completely out of fear and superstition. 'It takes time to construct new units,' Brantly said. '[And] a unit with beds but without staff is just a place for people to die. There's more incentive for people to stay home, where at least they're with their family.' Obama's strategy includes the provision of 400,000 home care kits, which Brantly said must be delivered without delay. The most important part, he said, are materials to protect and educate family members who remain with victims. Survivors of Ebola, who are immune to the virus, can also play an important role as health workers and communicators, but education is crucial to eliminate the fear surrounding those who have had the disease. '[Survivors] are often stigmatized and can't return to their communities safely,' Brantly said. 'If [we can support them], they will be able to do life-saving work and help; that can be mobilized more quickly than building new units. We need both, but home health care can happen immediately.'",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

(Logo: The survey of 1,004 U.S. adults, taken May 1-4, shows that four out of five of those surveyed reported that they are following the swine flu story very or fairly closely, and 36 percent said they were either very worried (8 percent) or somewhat worried (28 percent) about this flu virus. But the swine flu outbreak has prompted people to take more steps to prevent the spread of the virus, with 55 percent saying they are paying extra attention to proper hand washing, 48 percent covering their coughs more, and 41 percent disinfecting surfaces more. In addition, more than one in three have used hand sanitizers more and made an extra effort to avoid touching their mouth, nose and eyes. 'This swine flu virus continues to have the potential to spread throughout the U.S. Families, businesses and organizations should continue to follow good public health practices and to review and update their preparedness plans,' said Scott Conner, Senior Vice President, American Red Cross Preparedness and Health and Safety Services. 'Even if this version of the swine flu virus is not as dangerous as initially feared, public health officials worry that it could come back in a more severe form later this year. The Red Cross believes that prudent preparedness steps now can help keep families healthy throughout the year.' The Red Cross and public experts have recommended that common sense and basic public health practices should be followed. These include covering your cough/sneeze with a tissue, frequent hand washing, visiting a doctor for flu-like symptoms and staying home when sick. The survey did show that 11 percent said someone in the household had gone to work or school when they had the seasonal flu, and 22 percent indicated that they have gone to school or work within five days of having flu symptoms. Public health experts strongly advise people who are sick with the swine flu - or any other flu - to stay home from school or work in order to help prevent the spread of the virus. Other survey findings include: -- Two in five are misguided about flu shots as 39 percent incorrectly believe that a seasonal flu shot offers some protection from H1N1. -- Information on teaching children to wash hands carefully is important to three quarters of the public. The telephone survey of 1,004 U.S. adults 18 years and older was conducted May 1-4, 2009 by CARAVAN(R) Opinion Research Corporation. The margin of error is +/- 3.1 percent.

HAAN, the XXXXXX Find Members Post a Job Press Releases The information on this page is provided by PR Newswire. LANCASTER, Pa., Oct. 13 /PRNewswire/ -- While Americans anxiously await the arrival of the H1N1 Flu Vaccine in their area, many are seeking new methods to try to keep their homes germ free and their families healthy during this flu season. HAAN, the Steam Cleaning Experts, offer fast and effective ways to easily maintain a sanitized home without the use of harsh chemicals. The company's full line of steam cleaning products for the home uses the power of 212 degrees F steam to kill 99.9% of bacteria, simply with the use of water. (Photo: ) HAAN urges Americans to embrace the new, clean and effective technology to clean with the power of steam. With this in mind, HAAN offers a few simple tips to help keep you and your family healthy during this flu season: -- Blow-dry Before Bed and Blow Away Germs: Falling asleep with wet hair not only creates unwanted morning bed head, but a pillow case full of germs and dust mites. -- Kill Cabin Fever: Cold weather means more indoor play-dates for children. Help prevent illness by using non-toxic cleaning tools like HAAN's HS20 Handheld Steamer to kill bacteria on toys, or the MS30 Multi-Function Steam Cleaner to sanitize floors and play areas with just the power of steam. -- Conquer Computer Contamination: Hefty amounts of homework equals multiple people logging long hours on the house computer. Dirty hands and fingers can unknowingly easily pass germs from one family member to the next. Wipe down computers with sanitizing cloths. -- Wallop Bacteria out of Wet Winter Hats, Scarves and Gloves: Many don't realize that that pile of wet hats, gloves and scarves left in a heap by the front door are the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. For a quick and effective fix, HAAN, the Bacteria Beating Specialists, suggest using their HS20 Handheld Steamer to blast away bacteria at 212 degrees F. Hold the steamer one inch away from the items, and simply steam away the bacteria on contact. -- Hand Sanitizers for the Home: Dirty hands can spread germs and bacteria throughout your home. In addition to promoting hand washing among family members, keep hand sanitizers strategically placed in each room of the house for easy accessibility. Additionally, provide each family member with a travel sized bottle to carry in their purse, backpack or briefcase. -- Dust mites and dreams do not make good bed partners: Invisible dust mites and bacteria that live in your mattress can make you ill even when you sleep. HAAN's GS60 Steam Station kills these living organisms on contact by passing the head of the steamer over the entire mattress, leaving you assured that all you'll get is a good night's sleep!

2597002,ebola,GIN,7/9/2014 5:08,NA,"TORONTO - The largest Ebola outbreak in history is defying the containment efforts of affected countries and international response teams, leading to calls from some quarters to use experimental drugs or vaccines to try to stop the deadly virus. But a number of experts — including the scientist who led the work on a Canadian-made Ebola vaccine — say deploying untested tools in the current West African outbreak could be disastrous. They say taking such a risky gamble could further erode local trust in the response teams, undermine their efforts and even endanger them. And if anyone were to have a bad reaction to one of the experimental therapies, it could jeopardize years of expensive and painstaking work spent developing tools with which to fight Ebola and its cousin, the Marburg virus. 'I get emails basically every second day from someone either asking 'Is there something that you're planning?' or 'Shouldn't you?' And I know I'm not the only one getting those emails,' says Dr. Heinz Feldmann, an Ebola expert who heads the laboratory of virology at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont. While most of these discussions are happening within scientific circles, the director of Britain's Wellcome Trust recently aired the issue publicly. Dr. Jeremy Farrar, an infectious diseases expert, has questioned why the therapies that are furthest along in the developmental pipeline aren't being used. He suggests if this outbreak were occurring in the developed world, there would be no debate. 'Imagine if you take a region of Canada, America, Europe and you had 450 people dying of a viral hemorrhagic fever. It would just be unacceptable — and it's unacceptable in West Africa,' Farrar says. He notes the Canadian-made Ebola vaccine — a project Feldmann led a decade ago when he worked at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg — was released under emergency use provisions in 2009 when a German researcher pricked herself with a needle containing Ebola virus. She survived, but it was never clear if it was because of the vaccine or because she was not infected. 'We moved heaven and earth to help a German lab technician. Why is it different because this is West Africa?' Farrar asks. A small community of researchers, mostly based in Canada and the United States, has been working for years on vaccines and drugs to protect against or treat these viruses, which are among the deadliest known to humankind. The viruses are transmitted through contact with bodily fluids. People caring for the dying — or preparing their bodies for burial — are often infected. With little to offer medically, the main job of response teams is to break the chains of transmission by figuring out who is infected and isolating them. But these efforts are often met with distrust. Rumours emerge that the Western doctors are harvesting organs; people hide cases or flee — extending the range of the epidemic. World Health Organization says the current outbreak — the first in West Africa — has seen 844 cases in three countries, and 518 deaths. That's already virtually double the size of the next largest outbreak, in Uganda in 2000. And this outbreak isn't anywhere near over. A number of vaccines are in various stages of development. Studies done in non-human primates suggest they could both prevent illness and improve survival chances if given after infection. There are also a number of therapies in the works, including antibody combinations that look promising in animal testing. But the researchers have always been stymied by the challenges of getting regulatory approval for these interventions, which cannot follow the traditional pathways to licensure. Most drugs or vaccines can only make it to market once large scale studies show they are both safe and effective. But the only way the world will learn if Ebola and Marburg vaccines and drugs work is by using them in an outbreak — a reality rife with ethical concerns and logistical problems. In the current context, with response teams struggling to gain the co-operation of fearful locals, word that experimental treatments were to be used could further exacerbate an already taxing situation, says Dr. Armand Sprecher, of Medecins Sans Frontiers (Doctors Without Borders). The organization warned recently that the outbreak was out of control and said it was stretched to its limits. 'I would hate to cause more problems than we solve in the short run,' Sprecher says. 'Right now people are at their wits end just to deliver the care that we're able to provide.' Dr. David Heymann, a professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says after this outbreak is contained, the WHO, Ebola researchers, the countries they work in and the countries which are prone to these epidemics need to sit down and plan how they will deploy and test these therapies the next time. They need to have the study protocols ready to be signed. 'It would be unethical to roll it out now, in my opinion,' says Heymann, a former assistant director general at the WHO and a member of the team that responded to the first Ebola outbreak in 1976. Feldmann agrees with Heymann's idea. Over the years he has been frustrated by the inability to get these needed tools approved. But he says he has been persuaded by friends working on the current response that using untested and unlicenced medical interventions now would be a mistake. One was blunt about how badly awry such an effort could go. 'He said 'Anything injectable would be a disaster.' He thinks the rumour that we're just spreading the disease is going to be out there before we even start,' Feldmann says. 'I think as bad as it sounds — and I really don't feel good about saying this — I have the feeling they have to find a way to end this one without (experimental) therapy.'",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2900429,ebola,GIN,10/25/2014 3:40,1,"A two year-old girl, who tested positive for the Ebola virus in Mali, died Friday amid suspicion from the World Health Organization, or WHO, that she might have come in contact with several more people in the country. She had travelled from Guinea to Mali’s western town of Kayes with her grandmother while she was ill and tested positive for the virus on Thursday. The girl, whose name has not been released, was diagnosed with the virus in Kayes on Thursday, making Mali the sixth African nation to have a confirmed Ebola case and death. The WHO is monitoring 43 people, including 10 health workers, in Mali who are suspected to have come in contact with the girl. The organization has sent experts to Mali to help prevent the spread of the disease, which has killed nearly 4,900 people and has infected close to 10,000 people mostly in West Africa. 'In this moment of sadness, the government would like to express its condolences to her family and reminds the population that maintain very strict hygiene rules remains the best way to contain this disease,' Mali’s government said in a statement, according to the Telegraph. Authorities from the United Nations fear that Mali, one of the poorest countries in the world, may struggle to control the spread of the disease. The WHO said that an investigation into the girl’s case showed that she had already started showing symptoms before being taken to Kayes, making her contagious and raising the risk of more people being infected. “The WHO is treating the situation in Mali as an emergency. The child’s symptomatic state during the bus journey is especially concerning, as it presented multiple opportunities for exposures -- including high-risk exposures -- involving many people,” the WHO said in a statement Friday, adding: “Key staff from WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were already in Mali assisting with the country’s preparedness measures, should an imported case occur.” ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

The event will feature an interview between Weeks and a Liberian student, also named Althea Weeks, whom Weeks met through unlikely means: the “miracle of Facebook.” “A few years ago, she was just, ‘Hey, you’re Althea Weeks and I’m Althea Weeks — we should be friends,’” Weeks said. “She friended me and she found me and we just started chatting. We’ve been good friends ever since.” Before the Ebola outbreak, the Liberian Weeks attended the University of Liberia as a civil engineering major. Over the last six months, however, her school has been closed and her scholarship might be revoked as a result of the Ebola outbreaks. “Student to student, I know if I couldn’t go to school, I would be really upset and hurt and feel like I can’t do anything with my life,” Weeks said. “Here’s an individual who’s in that exact situation, on top of having the life threatened by just leaving her house.” Donations can be made to Althea4Althea’s Community Funded campaign, which has a goal of 800 dollars.

The district hospital is already dealing with at least 2 cases of malaria every day, while cases of dengue are also being reported daily. Doctors said that the numbers are likely to rise even more in August. Health officials said last month saw more people getting affected by malaria in Noida. 'We have had 99 cases till now as per the latest report of July. This number is surely going to go up in the month of August,' said Satyendra Kumar, district malaria officer. Doctors at the district hospital said that every day a number of patients coming in displaying symptoms of malaria and dengue — fever, cold, cough, etc — and out of these patients at least three inevitably have malaria. 'Initially, the patients are given medicine to boost their blood platelet count. If that doesn't help, we refer them to other hospitals,' said a senior doctor at the hospital. Health department officials said that the cases of malaria till now have been restricted to rural areas of the district. 'Most of the cases that have come up till now have come from Jewar and Dadri belts. We are taking steps to ensure that the breeding of mosquitoes is kept to a minimum. Anti-larva sprays are being used in places that we have identified as risk areas,' added Kumar. Strict orders have been given out to all private hospitals to report any cases of suspected dengue to the district hospital. After which the district hospital will forward the patient to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme in Delhi. Only after the patient has been verified by the Programme in Delhi, will the case of dengue be declared.

314754,influenza,USA,10/23/2009 5:31,NA,"Fifth-grader Grace Garrity works with her water bottle nearby at Immaculate Conception Elementary School. Because of the H1N1 virus, the Clintonville school asks students to carry water bottles rather than use drinking fountains. Custodian James U. Daly cleans a drinking fountain at Immaculate Conception school. The school's fountains are wiped down three times a day. On a scale of one to 10, Ben Spaulding rates his fear of contracting H1N1 flu an eight. But, the 11-year-old said his anxiety is more about what he would miss. 'If I got it, then I can't play football, and when I came back, I'd have a lot of work to catch up on in school,' said Ben, a fifth-grader at Buckeye Valley North Elementary School in northern Delaware County. You can't blame a kid for worrying these days. When they're not being told to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds -- long enough to sing a song -- they are being reminded to cough into their elbow, use hand sanitizer, keep their fingers out of their mouths, avoid water fountains and go straight to the nurse's office if they feel the least bit achy at school. Children younger than 18 are in one of the highest-risk groups for contracting the viral disease, also known as swine flu, and developing severe symptoms, but those interviewed this week weren't panicking. 'I'm just cautious,' said Anna Cox, 11, another fifth-grader at Buckeye Valley North. 'I'm not really nervous, but the way people talk about it, I think it can make you a little nervous.' Buckeye Valley was one of the first districts in central Ohio to see an upswing of illness-related absences this school year. During the last week of September, the 2,400-student district hit a peak of 270 absences, many of them at the middle school and high school. Since then, said district Superintendent John Schiller, illness has been creeping into Buckeye Valley's three elementary schools. Statewide, 20 school buildings and two child-care centers have closed because of high illness rates since the school year started, Ohio Department of Health spokesman Kristopher Weiss said. The four closings in central Ohio have all been charter schools in Franklin County. At Immaculate Conception Elementary School in Clintonville, nearly 60 students, or 13 percent, of the 460 kindergartners through eighth-graders were absent Wednesday, Principal John Grossman said. The usual rate is 3 percent to 5 percent. Staff members debated turning off water fountains but instead decided to disinfect the fountains three times a day and encourage students to bring water bottles -- labeled with their names -- from home. 'Mostly, we're just reinforcing what we've taught all along about good hygiene,' Grossman said. 'We don't want to be going over the P.A. and scaring kids.' Stemming the spread of germs without scaring students is a challenge for educators, said Katherine Cowan, a spokeswoman for the National Association of School Psychologists, based in Bethesda, Md. The organization, along with the national Parent Teacher Association and the National Association of School Nurses, released guidelines this year for talking about the H1N1 virus with children. 'There's a very fine line on this issue of reinforcing the importance of proper prevention and not turning it into a crisis that doesn't exist,' Cowan said. 'Kids can handle just about anything, but they take their cues from adults.' Because the flu also brings with it a slightly heightened risk of death, some children will worry more, Cowan said. In central Ohio, there has been one reported school-age death -- Whitehall eighth-grader Jon Fowler, who died Oct. 8. 'A parent has to understand how their child understands death and address it at their level,' Cowan said. 'But you also have to reinforce for them that there is a difference between possibility and probability.' With most youngsters, Buckeye Valley North Principal Barry Lyons said, he sees H1N1 as 'a huge teaching moment.' Talking to parents, who are more likely to panic 'because it gets so hyped in the media,' can be frustrating, he said. But, for the most part, Lyons thinks that his staff and students are dealing well with the challenge. ",NA,NA,0,,,,,,,
2861890,ebola,SOM,10/14/2014 7:17,7,"A military medic at Sierra Leone's peacekeeping training centre in the capital Freetown has tested positive for the deadly Ebola virus, the spokesman for the West African nation's armed forces said on Tuesday. Colonel Michael Samoura had earlier told Reuters the infected man belonged to a battalion of some 870 soldiers due to be deployed as peacekeepers with the African Union's peacekeeping mission in Somalia. However, he later said the medic was not part of the force. The contingent would not be quarantined but could be placed under observation, Samoura added. 'We cannot rule that out but really there is no cause for alarm as far as the peacekeepers are concerned, because the peacekeepers have their own area where they are encamped. They have their billets far from where this individual was operating,' he said. A second senior military official, who earlier had said the contingent would face a 21-day quarantine, declined to comment further when contacted by Reuters. The battalion was due to relieve Sierra Leone's contingent already participating in the mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM, in July, but their deployment was delayed due to administrative issues, Samoura said. More than 4,000 people have died in the worst epidemic of the viral haemorrhagic fever on record, most of them in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The doctors' organization Doctors Without Borders said that there are now fresh cases--some even in areas that have previously unaffected by the disease. It further reported that it is now starting to affect new areas like the capital Conakry, as well as Macenta and Gueckedou. Guinea is popular for its weekly markets which are often attended by traders from other areas in the region and even from some other countries. After two months of not having new Ebola cases, Liberia has now also started to a see spike in the number of new Ebola cases. Earlier this year, there were 21 confirmed cases of the disease and 9 deaths in the area, according to the WHO. Bart Janssens, director of operations for the organization, said: 'It clearly indicates that the epidemic is not at all under control as we might have hoped one or two weeks ago, when we really saw cases continually going down over time.' Ebola--hemorrhagic fever that has a 90% fatality rate--still has no cure or vaccine. To address this concern, WHO sent five experts to Guinea and its nearby areas to help control it, and also to observe those people who have been affected. Ebola was first known in 1976, when it was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The name was derived from the Ebola River, headstream of the Mongala River.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2936562,ebola,USA,11/7/2014 0:26,0,"Nurse Kaci Hickox recently returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone with the charity Doctors Without Borders and sparked a controversy in New Jersey. Governor Chris Christie ordered the charity worker detained in quarantine over fears she may have been infected with the virus, despite the fact that she was and remains asymptomatic. Conventional wisdom holds that the disease is only spread by symptomatic sufferers. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been the most deadly on record, with a death toll hovering just under 5,000 in the eleven months since the first reported case in Guinea. There is so little known about this mysterious disease that has a scary habit of jumping out of the bush, infecting and killing a large number of people, and then receding quietly back into the jungle. It’s elusive, has a very high mortality rate, no known cure, and has little prevention. It’s the stuff of nightmares. It’s terrifying the populace of Africa and scaring citizens of the United States. The recent domestic infection of two nurses that cared for the very ill Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas, Texas put Americans on high alert. The fact that one of the nurses traveled from Dallas to Cleveland, Ohio while possibly symptomatic ignited widespread panic. But nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson did not infect anyone else. Both women have recovered from the infection and the more than 200 people that were potentially exposed are expected to be released from daily monitoring protocols late Friday afternoon with no other infections reported. Thomas Duncan died, tragically. He alerted medical personnel of his travels to Africa but concealed his contact with Ebola infected individuals. No one that examined him initially became ill. Neither did the family members he was staying with, even after his illness progressed. The two nurses that contracted Ebola had contact with Mr. Duncan when he was at his sickest, when he was suffering from the highest viral load. Governor Chris Christie may have capitalized on the spreading fear when he ordered returning nurse Kaci Hickox held in isolation in New Jersey upon her return to the United States. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, the entity that conducted a poll of New Jersey voters, found that a large majority of voters, upwards of 67 percent, said they approved of his decision to detain the nurse, with only 19 percent disapproving. In Murray’s opinion, the New Jersey governor’s decision was a good political move. “Gov. Christie has made a good read of how uneasy the public is with the seemingly uncertain response from the feds. The Ebola issue has offered him an opportunity to take on the mantle of leadership.” But this good political move may not be a sound scientific move, which serves only to foster fear and suspicion against those who have the gumption to volunteer to help fulfill the desperate medical need for Ebola patients. The U.N. Secretary General is cautioning against placing unnecessary restrictions on those that are returning from West Africa. However, fear of the unknown is a powerful motivator and around 75 percent of people surveyed by a Reuters and Ipsos Mori poll said that they believed that heath care workers should be quarantined. Conditions in most of the West African treatment centers are deplorable. They often lack gloves and basic protective gear. The two nurses that contracted Ebola in the U.S. claim that they were given insufficient protective equipment and training to be in contact with a patient as sick as Mr. Duncan. The average citizen is at very little risk of contracting the disease, even if they are in close contact with someone who was exposed. While actual transmission routes are being questioned, transmission data in the United States actually shows that this disease is not easy to catch. New Jersey governor Chris Christie tried to capitalize on his constituents’ fears of the Ebola virus, to the detriment of Kaci Hickox. Governor Christie is critical of the way the federal government has handled issues related to Ebola infections and decided to institute his own containment methods. There have been many questions raised about the way in which the CDC is handling the infections and many criticisms lobbed over the mistakes made by the agency, but the relative difficulty in transmission has prevented a wider-spread outbreak. However, New York, New Jersey and Maine governors have gone above and beyond federal recommendations in instituting quarantines in place of twenty-one day monitoring for potential exposures. While quarantine is the best way to break the transmission chain, quarantining and shunning those who aren’t contagious (at least by any known metric) is not going to protect anyone. An article by the Inquisitr shows the fear based hatred being lobbed at Ms. Hickox, but scientific data thus far proves that she’s not a threat. ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

The latest government figures put the nationwide tally at 401, up nearly 100 from earlier in the day, with the total in Victoria accounting for 306. Most of the new cases were detected in children aged between five and 18, according to the AAP news agency. Another 64 cases were counted in New South Wales, where infected passengers left a luxury cruise liner last week before fanning out into the wider community. The scare has prompted a series of emergency measures with 14 schools closed, most in Victoria.

Several fresh dengue cases were detected at Noorsarai and Islampur in Nalanda district in the last 24 hours. The disease is reported to have spread its tentacles in the district as dengue positive cases were detected at the district headquarters, Biharsharif and Rajgir, in the last 48 hours. A dengue affected person identified as Hardesh Kumar, son of one Baldeo, a native of Belsar village under Noorsarai block, died at a Patna clinic on Sunday, where he was admitted a week back. On Saturday, Dhananjay Kumar, son of Suresh Painter, a resident of Dayanagar locality of Noorsarai, died at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on Saturday. He was diagnosed dengue positive on September 14. Confirming that a Biharsharif resident had tested dengue positive at the sadar hospital, Civil Surgeon Dr Jawahar Khan said just because a dengue positive case had been detected in a particular locality, it cannot be assumed that the locality is affected by the disease. He said that sanitation work has been started at Biharsharif and Rajgir. A Biharsharif doctor said he has detected dengue positive strains in several Biharsharif patients who were referred to Patna. After the residents of Noorsarai blocked Patna-Biharsharif NH-81 for hours on Sunday to demand compensation to the kin of Dhananjay who died at PMCH on Saturday, the director-in-chief, health services, Dr Surendra Prasad and deputy director Dr Jagdish Singh visited Noorsarai and met the family members of the deceased. They also reviewed medicare facilities available in the district on Sunday evening. The civil surgeon, who accompanied them, said pits and ponds were full of drain water and filth. He said measures like fogging and bleaching would be effective only when the filth from those pits is removed. Terming the alarming situation as 'under control', he said the number of new cases has come down in the last two days. While on way to Biharsharif to attend party workers' meeting there, RJD MP Ram Kripal Yadav visited the family members of Dhananjay Kumar at their residence and said his partymen are with them. He demanded adequate compensation to the family from the government. Sources said fogging and other sanitation work were carried out at Islampur on Friday when the principal secretary, health, Depak Kumar visited the affected areas, but slowed down thereafter.

2780652,ebola,LBR,9/17/2014 8:54,NA,"Albert Travell prays for his family in Liberia as he sits in the balcony at First United Methodist Church in Arlington. He started getting calls from his home village in July when a niece died. They thought it was malaria, so other relatives handled the body. They started dying, too. Ebola claimed seven of Travell's relatives in quick succession. 'Another one. Then another one,' he said. 'I don't know how to think about it.' Travell, an electrical technician, had not. been back to Liberia since he left as a student in 1976. He returned in May with a non-profit called Power From The Son. His friend, Steve Vincent, founded it to provide electricity to schools and hospitals in Liberia. The Ebola outbreak was small when Vincent and Travell traveled to Africa in the spring. Power from the Son has a grant to electrify another school, but right now it's just not safe enough to go back. 'It's all put on hold,' Vincent said. 'Nothing is happening.' He said a hospital he helped five years ago is now down to just two doctors. Travell said his family in Liberia can't get any kind of medical care; the more pressing problem is hunger. 'No food,' he said. So he sends money to his homeland. 'What can I do?' he asked, answering his own question with this: 'Pray to God.'",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2892286,ebola,NGA,10/23/2014 0:18,0,"Aid workers in Liberia tried out a new tool this week to contain the world’s worst Ebola outbreak: the text message. Using technology that can target mobile phones in a specific area, workers with the United Nations Children’s Fund sent texts to a group of Monrovia teenagers telling them how to sign up for Ebola alerts. The teens texted back questions, such as how can they avoid getting sick? The back-and-forth is part of an urgent effort to use technology to help combat the virus. Aid workers say while the technology is promising, limited Internet and data connectivity in the rural areas of West Africa has become a significant obstacle. “The system is frankly breaking,” said Lauren Woodman, chief executive officer of NetHope Inc., a nonprofit that is coordinating technology for aid groups in the region. “Our member organizations are telling us they may try and make a single phone call for hours. Text messages are being delivered two or three days later. Mobile payments for health workers are sometimes taking a week to process.” Government agencies, international organizations and nonprofits are expanding the use of technology to help stop an epidemic that has infected almost 10,000 people, killing about half. Aid workers are using phones with Google Inc. (GOOG:US)’s Android to track victims, software to monitor Twitter and other social media to find outbreaks and satellite-based systems to connect rural makeshift hospitals to the Internet. “Everybody’s trying to leverage technology in one way or another,” said Gisli Olafsson, emergency response director for NetHope, a Fairfax, Virginia-based coalition of 41 international organizations providing $40 billion in humanitarian assistance. The text testing this week, for example, is part of an education campaign that will start in the coming days, Christopher Fabian, a senior technology adviser with UNICEF, said in a phone interview from Monrovia. Organizations are working to overcome limited connectivity. Health workers in the three most-affected countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, are starting to receive mobile phones with an Android app. It allows them to log data about victims, such as their symptoms and locations, so virtual case files can be created. “The apps allow for case investigations to be entered and saved on the phone,” Adam Thompson, chief executive officer of eHealth & Information Systems Nigeria, a Santa Ana, California-based nonprofit operating in Nigeria, said in an e-mail. Nigeria Success The app can be used without an Internet connection and then data will be uploaded when service becomes available, said Thompson, whose organizations provided similar phones to aid workers in Nigeria in a $14 million effort. In Nigeria, the phone app reduced reporting times for new Ebola cases by half initially, and then by 75 percent before becoming almost real-time, said Daniel Tom-Aba, senior data manager at the Ebola Emergency Operation Centre in Lagos. For the other countries “we’ve not reached the scale where we can show or measure the impact,” Thompson said. Communication Tools The Liberian government is using a system that captures the time and location of mobile phone calls made to emergency services, said Carl Kinkade, an information technology coordinator with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which works with the government. The system enables workers to analyze areas where assistance may be needed, said Estella Geraghty, chief medical officer for the Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc., which developed the software that runs it. The company also offers mapping services and technical support, as well as software that can monitor and analyze Twitter (TWTR:US) and other social media sites for key words, Geraghty said. “This is team science at work,” Geraghty said. “There is no one entity that can solve this alone. We need to gather expertise from many different areas and put these brilliant minds and technology to work.” Lab Results The Liberian government is testing a system that will allow clinics in remote areas to immediately receive lab results by text messaging so they know if a patient is positive for Ebola or not, said Kinkade, with the CDC. It can now take up to three days for lab results to be delivered to a clinic by car. “It’s imperative that results get back as soon as possible,” Kinkade said in a phone interview. “If they know a case is negative, that person can be released. By releasing them you open up a bed and that allows somebody else waiting outside to come in.” The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is using software to send out about 2 million text messages a month in Sierra Leone about Ebola, said Robin Burton, a consultant for the organization.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

292972,influenza,USA,9/17/2009 0:48,NA,"The US Food and Drug Administration Wednesday approved the H1N1 influenza vaccine from four different manufacturers, clearing the way for the vaccine to be administered as soon as enough of it is available in that country. But authorities in India said there is still some time before a vaccine is available here. 'We have to wait for the results of our own trials before we give approval here. The USFDA approval doesn't change anything in India. The companies have to do bridging studies here,' said Dr V M Katoach, DG ICMR and Secretary, Health Research. The vaccines approved in the US are made by Australia's CSL Ltd., Switzerland's Novartis, France's Sanofi-Pasteur and Maryland's MedImmune, which makes an inhalable vaccine that might be available by the end of the month. Licensing in the US means the authorities there consider the vaccine meets specific manufacturing and quality standards. The Indian officials insist that vaccine manufacturers will have to conduct limited trials in the country. The officials are insisting on trials to assess how Indians react to vaccines. 'The import of vaccines will also depend on the trial results,' said Dr Katoach. The Health Ministry, through the ICMR, has written to four international vaccine manufacturers to conduct trials in India. Out of the four, Glaxo SmithKline and Novartis have agreed to conduct the trials provided the government gives them some guarantee of purchase. A third company also agreed to conduct the studies on Wednesday, but officials are not willing to give out the name yet. The officials said talks are on with other companies as well and the government was working out how many vaccines were likely to needed in the country. The government will be placing orders with foreign companies for procuring vaccines for the health workers, who are first in the line in fighting the disease. The plan so far is to wait for indigenous vaccines. The licensing in the US was announced after officials from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced on Friday that the vaccine was safe and produced adequate immunity with only one dose. Early data on the H1N1 vaccines being tested world over show the vaccines to be highly effective with no adverse effects. Two articles published in the online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, which have the preliminary data of the H1N1 vaccine, say the single dose vaccines were working in over 95 per cent number of healthy adults. The data was eagerly anticipated as governments, public health officials, and other stakeholders respond to the first influenza pandemic in over 40 years. The USFDA approval was based on the data from these two studies. The US has ordered vaccine for 195 million doses. About 45 million doses are expected to be available by the middle of October, and officials are targeting those in the highest-risk groups primarily pregnant women and healthcare workers",NA,NA,0,,,,,,,
3089538,ebola,MLI,1/13/2015 11:53,0,"Since the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was officially declared on 22 March in Guinea, it has claimed more than 8,200 lives in the region. The outbreak is the largest ever, and is currently affecting four countries in West Africa: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Mali. Outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal have been declared over. A separate outbreak in DRC has also ended. In September, 2014, MSF called for states with biological-disaster response capacity to urgently dispatch human and material resources to West Africa, all three of the worst-hit countries have received some assistance from the international community. But foreign governments have focused primarily on financing or building Ebola case management structures, leaving staffing them up to national authorities, local healthcare staff and NGOs. Across the region, there are still not adequate facilities for isolating and diagnosing patients where they are needed. Other elements that are essential to an Ebola response – such as awareness-raising and community acceptance, safe burials, contact tracing, alert and surveillance, access to health care for non-Ebola patients – are still lacking in parts of West Africa. Two of the three clinical trials for different treatments led by MSF and three research institutions have started, while the third should start soon at MSF sites in West Africa. The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) is leading a trial for antiviral drug favipiravir at MSF’s facility in Guéckédou, Guinea. The inclusion of patients at this site has started mid-December. The University of Oxford leads, on behalf of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC), a Wellcome Trust-funded trial of the antiviral drug brincidofovir at Elwa3 in Monrovia. The inclusion of patients started on January, 1st. The Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) will lead a trial of convalescent plasma therapy at MSF’s Donka Ebola centre in Conakry, Guinea. This trial is expected to start in the coming weeks. The United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) is based in Ghana to pursue five strategic priorities: stop the spread of the disease; treat the infected; ensure essential services; preserve stability; and prevent the spread of the disease to countries currently unaffected. MSF has been responding to the outbreak since March. On December 30, there was almost 3,800 staff working in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Mali. Since the response began, 27 MSF staff members have fallen ill with Ebola, 14 of whom have recovered and 13 have died. The vast majority of these infections were found to have occurred in the community. MSF’s West Africa Ebola response started in March 2014 and counts activities in Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone. MSF currently employs 302 international and around 3 600 national locally hired staff in the region. The organisation operates eight Ebola case management centres (CMCs), providing approximately 650 beds in isolation, and two transit centres. Since the beginning of the outbreak, MSF has admitted more than 7,700 patients, among whom around 4,800 were confirmed as having Ebola. More than 2,200 patients have survived. More than 1,400 tonnes of supplies have been shipped to the affected countries since March. Guinea The overall situation in Guinea remains concerning. While the total number of new cases has been relatively stable during the last three weeks, the epidemic continues to spread geographically, with new districts declaring cases for the first time. Conakry and the surrounding areas account for approximately half of the cases in the country. Conakry Donka Ebola Management Centre in Conakry is admitting an average of 5 patients per day, mostly from Conakry. Since last week, MSF teams are involved in contact tracing activities too, in collaboration with MSF is looking for an appropriate site to setup a bigger Ebola Management Centre that will serve the Conakry area. Macenta MSF completed the handover of the Macenta center to French Red Cross in December. MSF teams left Macenta on 10 December. Guéckédou The number of admissions remains stable on the low side. As an average, 4 patients were hospitalized during the last days. The number of admitted patients has also decreased in surrounding Ebola centers in the region. The INSERM study (FAVIPIRAVIR) has started the week of December 15th. Kankan Kankan A new 20 beds CMC is being built in Kankan and Infection control has started in the Kankan General Hospital. Outreach activities have also started in Kankan and its surroundings. Liberia Monrovia - Elwa 3 Following the decrease in the number of patients in ELWA 3 (currently 3 confirmed and 4 suspect), teams have downsized ELWA 3 from a 250 bed facility to a 60 bed facility. The teams have also built a laboratory to help better monitor patients – it is expect the lab will open in the coming week. On the 9th of January a “stabilisation centre” for patients with acute illnesses who do not meet the Ebola case definition was open at ELWA 3. The idea is that patients will be stabilised (using universal precautions but not full PPE) before being transferred to an available hospital bed at another facility. This is to mitigate problems surrounding the transfer of untested non-cases to other hospitals which usually face lengthy delays and have in some cases resulted in the death of the patient. The trial of brincidofovir, led by an Oxford university team, started on January 1st.  Monrovia/Outreach Ambulance service have been set up with a dedicated hotline that the community can call if they have Ebola suspected cases. Teams refer Ebola patients from Gardnersville, New Georgia, Barnesville and Paynesville in Monrovia, to EMCs. Monrovia / Support to non-Ebola health facilities An MSF team is supporting five health centres in Monrovia with expertise in infection prevention and control; A team is also supporting the James Davis Junior Memorial Hospital (JDJ Hospital) in Monrovia providing expertise in paediatrics, infection control and triage. Rehabilitation of the premises has started to set up stringent infection control measures. Meanwhile, teams are working at the set-up of a MSF-run paediatric hospital in Monrovia. Monrovia/Transit Unit (Redemption Hospital) Since the opening of the Ebola Transit Unit at the Redemption hospital site in New Kru Town on 19 November, MSF has triaged 100 patients and admitted 51 to its Transit Unit.. Patients who are admitted and test positive for Ebola and those who are clinically unstable upon arrival, are transferred to ELWA3 immediately. Patients are followed up by the staff of the Redemption Unit throughout their time in treatment. Their families are offered psycho social support, including transport to visit patients at ELWA 3, which can be up to an hour journey in traffic. Those who recover continue to receive support from MSF in the weeks following discharge. In addition to running the ten-bed transit unit, MSF also supports the triage at Redemption Hospital's OPD. This is an extremely important step in the rebuilding of non-Ebola health services in Monrovia as Redemption Hospital has, been unable to run its normal operations since it was used as a holding centre for Ebola patients in August. Monrovia/ Health Promotion activities Health promotion teams are out in the community engaging in dialogue with interested community members about Ebola as well as running “training for trainers” for community based organisations and other actors, with the aim of continuing to spread correct messaging on Ebola through communities across Monrovia. Monrovia / Treatment and prevention of malaria The first two rounds of malaria drug distribution were completed, on November 21 and December 19, respectively. In total, more than 500 000 people have received their drugs in four neighbourhoods. A distribution of mosquito nets will take place early January. Rapid response teams / River Cess MSF has handed over to Partners in Health the 7 triage centres, set up at local health centres, as well as health promotion activities in the area end of December. Health staff in the area has been trained by MSF to recognise the symptoms of Ebola and to react accordingly. Rapid response teams / Grand Bassa The MSF intervention in Quewein, Grand Bassa County started on 2 December and was handed over at the beginning of January to Concern Worldwide and local Health authorities. MSF teams took in charge or organized the referral of about 50 patients in the area. Rapid response teams / Grand Cape Mount  There are currently up to three trains of active transmission in Grand Cape Mount county including one in an open cut mine. Following an evaluation, the team has decided to run mobile clinics in villages across the region to find active cases, train local health staff in proper triage and infection control procedures and fill a gap in primary health care. Foya After not having had any Ebola patients since October 30th and with new actors arriving in the area to support, MSF’s Ebola Management Center in Foya, Lofa County, was handed over on December 10th. In the lead up to handing the structure back to the NGO Samaritan Purse, MSF invested strongly in health promotion activities and in the training of health staff in the districts of Foya, Kolahun and Vahun. This will ensure a robust response should cases reappear in the area.  Between 2 August and 10 December, 695 patients were admitted to the centre, 384 of whom were confirmed Ebola cases, 154 recovered from the virus and were discharged home. Sierra Leone Operation Western Area Surge was launched December 16th, as an intensified effort to mobilize communities to identify potential Ebola cases and link them with care. The surge focused on door-to-door social mobilization as well as engagement with community leaders, including government, religious, and tribal groups, as well as youth leaders and women. The outcomes of the Surge are currently unknown, though there has been a 10% increase in calls to the Ebola hotline and a slight increase in Ebola-positive cases in MSF’s Ebola Treatment Center in Freetown. These increases are substantially less than expected, indicating a potential shortfall in the social mobilization effort. On New Year’s Eve, President Koroma extended the surge for another two weeks and expressed hope that schools would reopen soon. Kailahun Teams continue to reinforce outreach activities, including monitoring of surveillance activities by other actors and assistance where needed. The MSF EMC in Kailahun has admitted no positive cases since December 11th. Following the opening and increased capacity of treatment centres in other districts both by MSF (Bo, Magburaka, Freetown) and other actors (Kenema, Makeni), no patients from other districts have been admitted since November 30th. A small but significant number of patients presenting with Ebola like symptoms continues, but since 11th December all have tested negative to Ebola. While Ebola is still present in other districts, the possibility will remain that travelers may present with Ebola in Kailahun. The bed capacity in the EMC was reduced to 20 beds – although it can still be upgraded to 100 beds again in the future if needed. Bo The MSF EMC centre in Bo saw a decrease of cases in late December following the opening of more treatment facilities in different regions of the country, although the current situation in Kono led to a slight increase of patients last week. As of January 4, there are 20 patients in isolation – 16 confirmed cases, one probable and three suspects. MSF continues to provide Mental Health services in the EMC as well as strengthening Health Promotion activities focusing in hotspot, training community health workers and visiting all quarantine houses, as well as support to the organization and dispatching of the alerts team. Magburaka 15 confirmed patients and 5 suspects are currently present in the EMC. Last week, the first cured patient was discharged. Since then, 4 cured patients have been discharged in total. The Winnipeg Laboratory, installed inside the EMC, is operating as district lab - working with three other holding centers and 11 CCCs in the area. It has a turnaround time on lab samples of 4 hours, which helped reduced the number of patients in holding centers. The team is currently evaluating the possibility of starting outreach activities. Kissy MSF has opened this week an Ebola Treatment Center in Kissy, one of the current hotspots of the epidemic, in the outskirts of Freetown. The current capacity is of 20 beds, but the centre will expand to become a 80-bed referral center for Ebola positive pregnant women, with an isolation ward for suspect Ebola-infected pregnant women, where they will be able to receive obstetric care. Freetown/antimalarial distribution Freetown/antimalarial distribution MSF will begin the second round of antimalarial distribution on January 16-19th for a target population of 1,8 million people. Teams will run house-to-house distribution of antimalarial drugs, sensitization on how these medications should be used for malaria prevention, and directly observed therapy (DOT) to support adherence. A large campaign of social mobilization has been run (radio, TV, posters, banners, as well as meetings with community leaders and stakeholders). Freetown/ Prince of Wales secondary school The Ebola Treatment Center at Prince of Wales School has reached its full capacity of 100 beds, though the centre was only one-third full last week. The center includes 30 individual rooms for suspect cases to prevent cross-infection, as well as 70 treatment beds, including an intensive care ward with a Plexiglas corridor to enable more intensive monitoring. Delays between onset of symptoms and access to treatment remain the most significant factor related to mortality. Since the centre opened on December 10, there have been 178 admissions, 82 Ebola confirmed patients, 30 Ebola deaths and 32 survivors. The center has a mobile lab on premises which currently tests 30 samples per day, and can scale to 50 samples tested per day Outreach activities have begun in the neighboring areas of Kroo Bay and Congotown. MSF is also supporting infection prevention and control (IPC) training for NGOs that are responding to Ebola cases alerts. MSF will add an additional car to this alert response, providing health promotion, as well as additional IPC support. Mali Mali confirmed its first case of Ebola on 23 October. In total, 8 cases were confirmed, and 6 deaths. There are no more contacts-people followed, as the last 13 contacts completed the 21-days of surveillance on 15 December. MSF emergency response unit, who was running a case management centre (CMC) in Bamako collaboration with CNAM, Mali’s national disease centre, left on January 5. Nigeria WHO declared 20 October as the official end of the epidemic after 42 days without a case. The MSF intervention has been closed. Senegal WHO declared 17 October as the official end of the epidemic after 42 days without a case. The MSF intervention has been closed. MSF’s West Africa Unit (Dakar) will keep in contact with the government for follow up as part of their routine activities. Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) The outbreak in DRC’s Equateur province, which was unrelated to the one in West Africa, was declared over on November 21.

The number of confirmed swine flu cases in the U.S. reached 40, although the reported cases still remain relatively mild and do not appear to be life-threatening. The Center for Disease Control addressed the situation Monday in a press conference, urging Americans to postpone unnecessary travel plans to Mexico. Additional concerns were raised as Lawrence Summers, director of the White House National Economic Council, stated that he expects the U.S. economy will continue to decline for some time to come in an interview on 'Fox News Sunday'. Summers also said that it was clear that there were going to be sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year.

582452,cholera,HTI,11/17/2010 23:40,NA,"Stockholm, Nov 18 (DPA) A Swedish diplomat claimed Wednesday that Haiti's cholera outbreak originated in Nepal. 'Unfortunately that is the case. It has proved that the cholera came from Nepal,' Claes Hammar, Sweden's ambassador to Haiti, told daily Svenska Dagbladet. Hammar, who visited Haiti two weeks ago, said the information came from 'a diplomatic source. It is 100 percent true. Tests were made and the source was traced to Nepal.' On November 1, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said the cholera strain linked to the outbreak is 'most similar' to cholera strains found in South Asia. However, it cautioned that more work was needed to determine the origin of the cholera strain in Haiti. The Nepalese Army Tuesday refuted charges that its peacekeepers were responsible for the epidemic that has claimed more than 1,000 lives, a day after protests in Cap Haitien, Haiti's second-largest city. One person was killed and at least 12 people, including six Nepalese soldiers, were injured in clashes resulting from the protests, in which thousands of people participated. 'The UN has already issued a press release saying the Nepalese forces were not responsible for the cholera outbreak after conducting a series of tests,' Nepalese Army spokesman Ramindra Chettri said in Kathmandu. The first outbreak of the disease, which is contracted through contaminated water and causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, was reported in the lower Artibonite region, north of capital Port-au-Prince Oct 22. On Tuesday, neighbouring Dominican Republic reported its first case of cholera - that of a migrant worker from Haiti. According to Partners in Health, Haiti has not had a documented case of cholera since the 1960s. But conditions were ripe for an epidemic even before the Jan 12 earthquake because of an unsafe water supply system, which was further weakened over the years by a series of hurricanes, followed by floods and mudslides. The earthquake killed close to 230,000 people and left more than 1.5 million homeless.",NA,NA,0,,,,,,,

The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, AHF, in a letter addressed to the AU chairperson, outlined four strategic interventions to the EVD outbreak ravaging the region. Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea are the worst hit by the virus that also spread to Nigeria and Senegal. The urgent call for action coincides with the emergency meeting of the African Union, AU, Executive Council. AIDS Healthcare Foundation, AHF, is the largest non-profit HIV/AIDS healthcare provider in the USA. AHF currently provides medical care and services to more than 340,000 individuals in 34 countries worldwide in the US, Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and Asia. In the letter, AHF's Africa Bureau Chief, Penninah Amor, stated that averting the outbreak would need to be an African priority, requiring both political and technical leadership on Ebola as the global response was totally inadequate. 'The AU can and should do more to avert the Ebola epidemic in West Africa,' she said. 'We are currently in the 9th month of this outbreak and we hope that in the spirit of the African Union, the AU is finally prioritising this matter so that we as a continent can support the countries ravaged by this epidemic and show the rest of the World the power of rallying together to bring this epidemic under control.' Her sentiments were echoed by chairperson of the African Union Commission, Nkosazana Zuma, who called upon African countries to show solidarity. 'We are gathered to show our solidarity, and to develop a collective, comprehensive, and coordinated strategy, so that our sisters and brothers, and the leadership of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and other affected countries know that they are part of a broader, caring African and global family.' The solidarity called for by Ms. Zuma has been notably absent as only Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda have contributed funds to tackle the disease.

3078636,ebola,LBR,1/8/2015 5:15,0,"A clinical trial of a possible treatment for Ebola began on the 1st of January at ELWA 3, MSF's Ebola Management Centre in Monrovia. Led by Oxford University, the trial aims to determine if the anti-viral drug brincidofovir is a safe and effective treatment for Ebola. Whilst MSF hopes that brincidofovir might help patients survive infection, it is still not sure whether this will be the case. The trial is designed without a control group and efficacy will be determined by comparing the outcomes of the patients who participate in the trial with the outcomes of patients treated at ELWA 3 earlier in the outbreak. Randomising patients to potentially receive a placebo was not considered ethical in the context of the current Ebola outbreak. 'We know that brincidofovir has been taken safely by over 1000 people in clinical trials for other viral infections and we know that is has been shown to be effective in laboratory tests that use Ebola-infected cells. What we do not know yet is if it will be effective against Ebola in humans - this is why this trial is necessary' says Dr Jake Dunning, Trial Clinical Lead for Oxford University. All new patients with Ebola positive blood tests will be given the opportunity to participate, with informed consent. Those who do not wish to be given the trial treatment will receive the same standard supportive care as those who do, but without the administration of the trial drug. 'With every possible treatment comes hope, and we are very excited that we may be able to help our patients beyond symptom management and routine supportive treatments like IV fluid therapy' says MSF medical coordinator Brett Adamson. 'But this treatment, even if shown to be effective, will not end the epidemic. We are in a crucial phase of the outbreak in Liberia, and there are still multiple chains of transmission which means that the situation is still not under control. A coordinated and holistic response is required but together we have a very real opportunity to bring the outbreak in Liberia to an end. 'If brincidofovir is shown to be safe and effective, it will be made accessible to Ebola patients in other Ebola treatment centres through advancing the trial to the next phase. The trial is running with the approval of the Liberian Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Authority (LMHRA), and ethics committees from the University of Liberia, MSF and Oxford University. Since July 2014, MSF has been responding to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia. Currently the organisation is running a 50 bed Ebola treatment centre, in Paynesville, Monrovia, a 10 bed transit unit at Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town, Monrovia and health promotion activities across the city. MSF employs some 1400 national and international staff on the ground in Liberia and has treated more than 1600 Liberians confirmed to be Ebola positive. MSF is also involved in a clinical trial in Guéckédo, Guinea, and expects to begin another trial in Conakry, Guinea in the coming weeks. In Liberia MSF ran emergency operations during the fourteen years of civil conflict that raged until 2004 as well as during the post war period before handing over all projects to the Ministry of Health and other NGOS and leaving the country in 2012",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2906863,ebola,GBR,10/27/2014 18:50,1,"Soldiers from Aberdeen Proving Ground are heading to West Africa to help with the overwhelming task the country has in diagnosing those patients with the deadly Ebola disease. Marcus Washington met with those soldiers who are now fighting a different type of war. It’s a war against time. There is only a small window to recognize the symptoms and get treatment and, for many of the countries in West Africa, they just don’t have the resources to meet the growing demand. The state of Maryland has a fight in the battle against Ebola, as 22 soldiers from Aberdeen Proving Ground head to Liberia in West Africa. “To set up small laboratories, where we will be testing local national population for Ebola,” said Col. Patrick Garman. This is the first and only Army unit from Maryland hitting the medical war zone where nearly 5,000 people have died from the disease. “I’m very well prepared and I just can’t wait to get there and help a lot of people,” said one. WJZ has learned that, while this unit will go over to West Africa to help the fight against Ebola, they will not have any personal contact with anyone infected with the disease. “A phlebotomist will draw a sample from the patient, a blood sample, and then those samples will be brought to the laboratory where we’ll do testing,” said Maj. Michael Backlund. “They and many other specialized labs are really in the best position to help people in West Africa,” said Jim Campbell, University of Maryland School of Medicine. University of Maryland School of Medicine researcher Jim Campbell says there is no way countries in West Africa could handle this epidemic alone. “So finding the people who have the disease by making diagnoses using these diagnostic tests and being able to isolate those who have the disease and then not have to isolate those who don’t have the disease and just have something else is very important in stemming the epidemic,” Campbell said. The unit from Aberdeen Proving Ground is scheduled to leave for West Africa this week. Their deployment could last up to 12 months. Those soldiers are all biochemists, microbiologists and lab specialists who have trained for this mission since August.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

The yearly flu shots that have been in use for many XXXXXX Choosing Treatment Facilities and Health Professionals You can help in the fight against cancer. Donate and volunteer. What is swine flu? Swine flu is also called novel H1N1. It is a new flu (influenza) virus that was first found in people in the U.S. in April 2009. While it is like seasonal flu, it is not the same. The yearly flu shots that have been in use for many years will not protect you from swine flu. Any flu shots you've had in the past, including the swine flu vaccine used in 1976, will not protect you from this new H1N1 virus. Why is it called swine flu? At first the H1N1 virus was called 'swine flu' because lab tests showed that it was a lot like influenza viruses that are normally found in pigs (swine) in North America. Now studies have shown that this virus is very different from the one found in North American pigs. And despite the name, swine flu is not linked to eating pork or pork products that have been properly handled and prepared. How is swine flu spread? The H1N1 virus is spreading by person-to-person contact worldwide, much the same way that regular seasonal flu viruses spread. Sneezing and coughing are the main way it is spread, but it people can also get swine flu by touching something with the virus on it and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus can live on surfaces for up to 8 hours. People who are infected shed the virus and may be able to infect others (are contagious) from 1 day before feeling sick, to up to 7 days after they have symptoms. Young children may be contagious for a longer time. What are the symptoms of swine flu? Symptoms of swine flu can range from mild to severe and include: fever cough sore throat runny or stuffy nose body aches headache chills extreme tiredness (fatigue) diarrhea vomiting If you have any of the following symptoms you should see a doctor right away: trouble breathing or shortness of breath lips turn purple or blue sudden dizziness chest or belly pain or pressure confusion ongoing vomiting and unable to keep down fluids seizures flu-like symptoms that seem to get better, but them come back with fever and worse cough Swine flu may last for a week or longer. Most people who have gotten sick with this virus have recovered without needing medical treatment. But severe illness, like pneumonia, and even death have been linked to swine flu. Certain health issues do seem to be linked to a higher risk of problems with H1N1 infection. These include: cancer people with weak immune systems, like those with AIDS or those getting chemotherapy lung problems, like asthma or COPD blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease diabetes weak immune system kidney disease heart disease liver problems certain nerve and muscle disorders What can I do to protect myself from swine flu? At this time there is no sure way to prevent swine flu. A novel H1N1 vaccine is now being made and tested, but it is not expected to be available to the public until fall 2009. Still, there are things you can do to try to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus and many other germs. Wash your hands a lot. Use soap and warm water or alcohol-based cleaners or wipes. Do not touch your eyes or nose. Keep your fingers out of your mouth. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Try to stay away from sick people. At least 6 feet is thought to be a safe distance. Try to stay away from small children who spend their days in group settings like daycare or school -- germs spread easily in these places. If you have symptoms of swine flu, stay home for at least 24 hours (unless you need to see a doctor). Try to stay away from other people for about a week. Be ready just in case you do get sick. Have the things you may need at home (food, tissues, medicines, and so on) so that you don't have to go out in public. You should also try to stay healthy. Get enough sleep, eat well, exercise, drink plenty of fluids, and manage stress. Follow public health advice about things like school closings and avoiding crowds, too. In some cases, prescription flu medicines and anti-viral drugs can be used to try to prevent swine flu in someone who has just been or may be near someone with it. They can also be used to treat people who have been infected. (See the section, ' Can swine flu be treated? ') More on the vaccine The H1N1 vaccine will help prevent the infection and will not cause the disease. When it is ready (maybe by mid-October 2009), certain groups of high-risk people will be able to get the vaccine first. This includes: pregnant women those who live with or take care of children under 6 months old health care workers and EMTs people between the ages of 6 months and 24 years people age 25 through 64 who are at risk of infection due to chronic health problem or weak immune systems -- this means people with cancer will be able to get it A vaccine shortage is not expected, and each state has its own vaccine delivery plan. You can learn more about your state's plan Keep in mind that the novel H1N1 vaccine does not replace the seasonal flu vaccine. It is to be used along with the seasonal flu vaccine to protect people. Seasonal flu and novel H1N1 vaccines may be given on the same day.. Can swine flu be treated? Prescription flu medicines like Tamiflu &reg; and Relenza &reg; can be used to treat and prevent swine flu. Other anti-viral drugs can also be used. These drugs are also available only by prescription. They work by keeping the virus from reproducing in your body. They can make the flu symptoms milder and can help you feel better faster. They can also help keep the infection from causing severe problems. Anti-viral drugs work best if they are started within 2 days after getting sick. What about people with cancer? Infections can be a special concern for people with cancer. Having cancer and cancer treatment can make your immune system weak and less able to fight germs. The information here should be used by people with cancer, too. Watch for the same symptoms and do the same things to try to keep from getting swine flu (and any other flu). Use caution, but don't panic. Talk to your cancer doctor about any special concerns you may have. Also ask if you may need to take medicines to try to prevent swine flu and whether you should get the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available. Remember that any former immunizations, including last year's flu vaccine or the 1976 vaccine, will NOT protect against the current strain. High-risk groups listed above, including those with cancer, should get the 2009 vaccine when it becomes available. Health care workers should also get the vaccine. In most people, swine flu is a limited illness that is not life threatening. It can be serious in the high-risk groups, and these individuals should receive priority for vaccination.

The formation of a District Ebola task force, according to Rep. Snowe is to help government eradicate the Ebola virus from Liberia. The lawmaker said this could only be possible if communities like his get involved in sensitization. Snowe said: 'As a representative of district #6 I will give to the district Taskforce the amount of five hundred thousand Liberian dollars and a pickup to be used for surveillance. I want to ask all of you to put hands on deck; we can only achieve this if we all work together.' He also said as part of support to the task force, several volunteers from the community would be trained in community engagement. He called on community members to give the volunteers the necessary cooperation as they go about doing their job. Need for radical response Also speaking at the launch the Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) political leader George Weah, stressed the need for unity among Liberians during this health crisis. He said as the country struggles to battle Ebola, which he described as the Nations common enemy, a swift response from all was needed. Weah said: 'Our country is in crisis and our response must be radical, we must change our actions and change our thoughts about this deadly virus. We cannot deny the existence of this virus anymore; too many people have died because of denial.' Weah continued: 'Health care workers are not spreading the virus, it is not a curse to have Ebola and there should be no shame in reporting the disease. I ask everyone to put aside their mistrust about healthcare workers and allow them into our communities and homes.' The soccer legend cautioned Citizens not to attend burial events, especially if the person is suspected to have died from Ebola. He warned people not to touch friends, Family members and loved ones showing symptoms of the disease because it is the active mode of transmission. Weah who once worked as a goodwill Ambassador at the level of the United Nations warned Liberians against rumors about traditional or spiritual practices and beliefs about the virus not being real. He called on Liberians to continue to take the necessary preventative measures by continuously washing their hands to keep themselves and family members safe from the virus.

The World Bank has dramatically downgraded its expectations for economic growth this year in the three countries hardest hit by the outbreak. Guinea will grow 2.4 percent, down from a previously forecast 4.5 percent, it predicts; Liberia 2.5 percent, down from 5.9 percent; and Sierra Leone 8 percent, down from 11.3 percent. 'It's been really devastating,' said Rosa Whitaker, CEO of the consultancy the Whitaker Group and a former U.S. trade official. It's an especially cruel turn for three impoverished economies that had been making steady progress after years of devastating conflict: — In Sierra Leone, which endured a civil war from 1991 to 2002 that killed 70,000 and left 2.6 million homeless, the economy surged 20 percent last year and 15 percent in 2012. — Liberia, which lost 250,000 people to civil wars from 1989 to 2003, has recorded double-digit economic growth four of the past five years. — Guinea, with a history of bloody coups and political strife, has grown more slowly (2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2012), but had expected its economy to accelerate as foreign companies invested in such projects as the Simandou iron ore mine. 'No one could have imagined the extent of the economic and social turnaround,' said Steven Radelet, a foreign aid expert at Georgetown University and an adviser to the Liberian government. 'The past 10 years, there's been remarkable progress, and a lot of investors coming in.' Ebola has frozen the economic revival. 'They were coming back and now have been set back in a big way,' said Francisco Ferreira, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa. The epidemic damages the economy directly. Commerce stops. The sick can't work. Contaminated areas close down. Tax collections dry up. Health care costs swell, squeezing governments already struggling with expenses. But the indirect damage can be even worse as fear paralyzes Ebola-stricken communities. 'People are obviously very afraid of it,' Ferreira said. 'People stay home and don't consume... Flights are being canceled because no one wants to go there. Hotels are firing people because no one is staying there.' Liberia canceled soccer games because it's 'a contact sport, and Ebola is spread through sweat,' said Musa Bility, president of the Liberia Football Association. The suspension of sporting events has hurt Boima Folley's sporting goods shop in the Liberian capital Monrovia. 'No one comes to even ask for — let alone buy — sports materials these days,' he said. Analysts are at least optimistic that the economic damage from the crisis can be contained to the hardest-hit countries. The three Ebola-stricken nations are, after all, economically small, and their troubles are unlikely to disrupt commerce beyond their borders: Combined, their three economies amount to half the size of Vermont's. This week, the International Monetary Fund this week forecast that the 25 African countries it has grouped as 'low-income'— including the three most hit by Ebola — would register a combined 6.3 percent economic growth this year, faster than the 6.1 percent in 2013. One factor in Africa's favor: Nigeria, West Africa's dominant economy, and Senegal moved decisively to identify and isolate Ebola victims and those who had come into contact with them. 'We're incredibly impressed by the ability of Nigeria and Senegal to keep their epidemics contained,' Ferreira said. The World Bank still fears a worst-case scenario in which Ebola breaks out of three countries and spreads across West Africa. Under that scenario, economic losses across West Africa would rise as high as $32.6 billion this year and next, up from no more than $9 billion if the disease were contained. Continent-wide, Africa has made significant strides. Six of the world's fastest-growing economies are in Africa, the White House reported at an August U.S.-Africa Summit meant to celebrate the continent's rise. Most analysts think Africa's overall economy will continue to expand. The momentum remains strong, and damage from Ebola still seems likely to be contained. 'I don't think there will be lasting damage,' said Anna Rosenberg, head of Frontier Strategy Group's sub-Saharan Africa practice. 'The growth story coming out of sub-Saharan Africa is too big and too real to be ignored. There's nothing that is going to stop it going forward.'",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

HUS said in a statement Friday evening that preliminary tests results show that a man suspected of having the disease was not, in fact, infected with the virus. Health officials say that the man is most likely suffering from a malarial infection.In a release issued early Friday evening HUS said that reports that a man admitted to a Helsinki hospital had been infected with the Ebola virus proved to be unfounded. In a press conference later on health officials said they suspect the man may be suffering from malaria. Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease whose symptoms - fever, fatigue, headaches and vomitting -- may resemble the early stages of Ebola. The hospital district said that initial tests have shown no signs of Ebola infection in the patient, who had been admitted to the Meilahti hospital in Helsinki Thursday evening. Further tests to be administered HUS said that the test results, which came in Friday evening, could be considered highly reliable. However the patient will remain in observation over the weekend while new tests are conducted, HUS added. HUS described the patient’s condition as good and said that his treatment is progressing well. Hospital officials said that they are operating according to standard procedures agreed with health authorities and noted that they are taking precautions to minimise unnecessary contact with other individuals. The middle-aged American man had traveled from Liberia to Finland at the beginning of October and recently sought medical care for a high fever. The man had reportedly been working in Liberia. Patient contacts known to authorities The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) said Friday morning that the people with whom the patient had been in contact since developing Ebola-like symptoms are now known. An Ebola infection is not contagious before symptoms are displayed, and even then the virus can only be transmitted via direct contact with bodily fluids. Earlier this week the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that there had been more than 13,000 cases of Ebola infections in West Africa this year, with nearly 5,000 deaths reported. The worst-affected countries include Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where all but 10 of the fatalities have occurred.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

But as an H1N1 epidemic draws closer, these centers look less like protective bastions and XXXXXX Childcare Centers &#151; and Parents &#151; Brace for Flu Season Children at a day care center listen to their teacher. Over the years, day-care and child-care centers have become a security blanket for millions of working parents who need their children looked after during the day. But as an H1N1 epidemic draws closer, these centers look less like protective bastions and more like potential H1N1 incubators. What You Need to Know About the H1N1 Vaccine 'Since the virus has emerged, we've seen a number of groups that are at higher risk for complications from H1N2, and these include children under five and, especially, children younger than two,' says Bill Hall, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services. 'Infants younger than six months cannot receive the H1N1 vaccine, because their immune systems are not developed enough to tolerate it,' he adds. To date, the CDC has recorded 76 deaths of children under 18. For day-care centers, that means more than just a risk of low child attendance; it's a huge potential liability. (See what you need to know about the H1N1 vaccine.) A parent whose child contracts H1N1 at a day-care center because of negligent supervision could sue the facility, says David Wolf, a child injury lawyer and partner at Wood, Atter & Wolf, in Jacksonville, Fla. Wolf concedes the mere acquisition of minor flu-like symptoms would typically be insufficient to litigate an injury case. But there is a potential, he says, if there's extended hospitalization, permanent injury or death. (To date, he is unaware of any such lawsuits.) To protect all parties, including owners, day-care center gatekeepers will need to play an increasingly prominent role in keeping symptomatic kids off the premises. Even though standards of efficiency in child-care centers, including appropriate staff-to-children ratios, cleanliness of the premises and good hygiene practices, are mandated, many day-care centers that operate in the U.S. are not in compliance with state regulations, says Wolf. Further, parents may not realize that most church-based day-care centers are exempt from certain regulations required by the state. (See how not to get the H1N1 flu.) As the media saturates consumers with swine-flu recommendations, however, many day-care-center owners are rising to the challenge. 'We started preparing last spring and have placed a heightened focus on retraining staff on hand-washing and sanitizing procedures throughout the center, with special attention in the sign-in area,' says Beth Woodward, spokesperson for Knowledge Learning Corporation, the parent company of KinderCare Learning Centers. (See pictures of thermal scanners hunting for swine flu.) Barbara Harwell, who has owned and operated Tender Loving Care, in Elkhart, Ind., for the past 18 years, has allocated more of her budget to bleach and cleaning products; she's been known to send home parents with their filthy diaper bags and instructions to wash them. But, says Wolf, it's not just up to the centers. Parents also need to be more vigilant. 'Day-care establishments are like nursing homes and hospitals,' he says. 'If you park a person there, and never visit, you'll never know what's going on.' See the most common hospital mishaps. 20 Years After the Bay Area Quake: Are We Better Prepared?

3091099,ebola,SLE,1/14/2015 2:16,0,"The head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says he remains 'very confident' the Ebola outbreak that has devastated West Africa can be stopped. Speaking at a meeting with public health officials and lawmakers Tuesday in Washington, Dr. Tom Frieden said the world will get to zero cases in the epidemic 'if we continue the way we are going and nothing unexpected happens.' He said 'the largest single risk' health officials face is that the disease may become 'endemic,' meaning it would continue to spread at a low rate. He said that is not an acceptable outcome, because it means it could 'flare up' again. The Ebola epidemic has killed more than 8,000 people of the more than 20,000 infected - most of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Frieden noted progress in the three most affected countries, but said the threat is 'nowhere near' eliminated. The CDC director said the epidemic has had an outsize impact on the health sector and society. Two new World Bank Group reports say the socio-economic impacts of Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone are 'far-reaching and persistent.' The group said Monday its latest mobile phone surveys show both countries continue to experience such Ebola side effects as job losses and food insecurity. As a result, it says the current and future prosperity of households are at high risk. ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

(NYSE: BAX) today announced that it completed production of its first commercial batches of CELVAPAN A/H1N1 pandemic vaccine in late July and is discussing plans for distribution with national health authorities, XXXXXX Baxter Completes Production of First Commercial Batches of A/H1N1 Pandemic Vaccine Highlight any phrase & click HotSearch DEERFIELD, Ill., August 5, 2009 — Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) today announced that it completed production of its first commercial batches of CELVAPAN A/H1N1 pandemic vaccine in late July and is discussing plans for distribution with national health authorities, subject to obtaining appropriate authorizations. CELVAPAN, the brand name for the company's A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine, is made using Baxter's proprietary Vero cell culture technology. &nbsp; Baxter plans to deliver initial quantities of CELVAPAN to national public health authorities that have pandemic agreements with the company. These health authorities placed orders for the vaccine following the World Health Organization's (WHO) elevation of the pandemic alert level to phase 6 and declaration of a pandemic. &nbsp; Baxter's proprietary Vero cell production technology is meeting the company's expectations to rapidly produce a vaccine in response to a pandemic. CELVAPAN was developed and commercially produced using this process within 12 weeks of receiving the A/H1N1 virus strain, which represents an innovation in vaccine production. &nbsp; “We are pleased with our company's ability to meet its expected timelines in developing and producing CELVAPAN,” said Joy Amundson, corporate vice president and president of Baxter BioScience. “This is an encouraging validation of our science, our Vero cell vaccine technology and the teamwork at Baxter in meeting this important milestone to help address an urgent public health issue.” &nbsp; Baxter is collaborating with regulatory authorities to ensure the company is in accordance with all requirements needed to support approval and use of CELVAPAN. “To make CELVAPAN A/H1N1 vaccine, we applied the same development, qualification and manufacturing processes used in gaining European Medicines Agency (EMEA) licensure of a mock-up pandemic vaccine,” said Hartmut J. Ehrlich, M.D., vice president of global research and development for Baxter BioScience. “The mock-up vaccine made with a different pandemic strain was tested in five clinical trials worldwide in more than 1,300 people. In addition, more than 3,500 people have been vaccinated during an ongoing phase III study.” &nbsp; Confirmatory clinical trials to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of CELVAPAN A/H1N1 in adults, the elderly and children are scheduled to begin in August. Baxter has initiated its license application for CELVAPAN A/H1N1 based on the EMEA published guidelines for pandemic vaccine marketing authorization and will supplement its application post-approval with the appropriate safety and immunogenicity data from the confirmatory clinical trials. Once national vaccination programs are initiated, Baxter will also conduct a large-scale observational study in people receiving CELVAPAN. In all countries, decisions to administer the vaccine will be determined by local public health authorities. &nbsp; ABOUT BAXTER'S PANDEMIC VACCINE DEVELOPMENT &nbsp; Baxter received the A/H1N1 strain for testing and evaluation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (a WHO Collaborating Center) in early May. The company then undertook pre-production testing and evaluation of the virus strain to assess its growth characteristics and ability to work in the company's proprietary Vero cell culture. Based on the virus' ability to grow in Vero cell culture, Baxter initiated commercial production on June 3, 2009. Bulk CELVAPAN vaccine is produced at its large-scale commercial facility in Bohumil, Czech Republic, and is sent to Vienna, Austria for the final formulation, fill and finish before distribution. &nbsp; Mock-up licensure is a regulatory pathway for pandemic vaccines that was created by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) in 2004. This pathway allows for the development, evaluation and testing of a company's vaccine production capabilities using an available influenza strain that has the potential to cause a pandemic. Once a pandemic is declared and the influenza virus strain causing the pandemic is identified, the mock-up licensure allows for fast track approval of a pandemic vaccine containing the actual pandemic strain. Other countries may choose to evaluate the company's EMEA submission and use that information as the basis for their national health authority's authorization for use of the vaccine. &nbsp; ABOUT BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. &nbsp; Baxter International Inc., through its subsidiaries, develops, manufactures and markets products that save and sustain the lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders,&nbsp;infectious diseases, kidney disease, trauma, and other chronic and acute medical conditions. As a global, diversified healthcare company, Baxter applies a unique combination of expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to create products that advance patient care worldwide. &nbsp; This release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company's vaccines products, including with respect to potential timelines. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: continued success in advancing a new technology through full-scale production, including with respect to steps required for finishing, release, shipment, and customer acceptance; remaining regulatory approvals; governments' continuing decisions with respect to orders; and other risks identified in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, all of which are available on the company's website.

3095493,ebola,LBR,1/15/2015 18:00,0,"Today, the World Health Organization issued a 14-part report on Ebola, from the moment it started until now. We asked our team of Ebola correspondents to look at the sections and pull out the points that seemed most interesting — that may have been overlooked or forgotten, stories that show how the virus turned into an epidemic. Where it all began The very first human case of Ebola in this outbreak may have been due to deforestation by 'foreign mining and timber operations' in Guinea, which brought residents in closer contact with bats. The first victim was an 18-month-old boy in Meliandou, a village of just 31 households. He had been seen playing near a tree infested with bats before he got sick. The child developed fever, had black stools and was vomiting on Dec. 26, 2013. He died two days later. Health officials first thought he had cholera. Anger in Guinea The Ministry of Health publicly described the outbreak as 'nearly under control' as early as April 15. But cases were on the rise. In September, Forecariah, a mining town in western Guinea, had a case fatality rate among Ebola patients of at least 80 percent; the virus was spreading among patients and staff in a large regional hospital. As the mob in Forecariah grew to more than 3,000 heavily armed youths, WHO-led epidemiologists became the target of their anger. The epidemiologists had to flee for their lives. The first in Sierra Leone Ebola arrived when an infected woman seeking the services of a faith healer crossed the border from Guinea. The healer became infected and eventually died. Her funeral became ground zero for the epidemic in Sierra Leone. Epidemiologists eventually traced 365 Ebola-related deaths to that single funeral. Not enough doctors Before Ebola struck, the three hardest-hit countries — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — had a ratio of about one to two doctors per nearly 100,000 people. A shocking burial connection Funeral practices in Liberia and Sierra Leone include rinsing a corpse and having mourners bathe in that water. The assistants of socially prominent members in secret societies in these countries have also been known to sleep near a highly infectious corpses to allow 'the transfer of powers.' A whopping 80 percent of Ebola cases in Sierra Leone are estimated to be linked to these funeral practices. In Guinea, it's 60 percent of Ebola cases. Ebola in the air Never before had air travelers brought the Ebola virus to a new country. That happened twice in this outbreak, when one infected individual flew from Liberia into Lagos, Nigeria, on July 20 and another from Liberia to Texas on Sept. 30. As the report notes, every city with an international airport is, in theory, at risk of an imported case. The littlest victims By the end of 2014, charities in West Africa were struggling to care for more than 30,000 Ebola orphans. No isolation In the early summer, no hospital in Liberia had an isolation ward. Facilities lacked protective equipment, and only a few medical staff were trained in the basic principles of infection control. As a result, treatment of the first hospitalized patients actually 'ignited multiple chains of transmission' and eventually led to an exponential growth in Ebola cases throughout the country. Continuing toll on health workers Despite progress in Liberia, infection control at health facilities is still a major problem. Six health workers were infected just in the first week of December. Health officials are investigating. Tough laws Sierra Leone used especially aggressive measures to try and contain the virus, though it's unclear what impact these had. Over the course of the year, the government quarantined more than half of the country's 14 districts and passed a law imposing a jail sentence of up to two years on anyone found to be hiding a patient. Malaria builds a bridge As part of its response, the Sierra Leonean government used an anti-malaria campaign to try and win back the public's trust in health care workers, whom they thought were possibly spreading the disease. With new Ebola cases still rising in December 2014, health facilities distributed anti-malarial medicine to tens of thousands of households in areas with the highest rates of Ebola and where fear was causing people to avoid contact with health workers. The WHO report says the program was well-received and boosted trust in the government. The need for rapid testing Many Ebola patients have been in a hellish limbo for days or longer while waiting for blood samples to be schlepped along rutted roads, to be tested for the virus. WHO is currently evaluating 19 different rapid blood test kits, which can be sent off to health outposts in remote areas. If a reliable one is found, that could make a big difference for patients waiting to find out if their fever is caused by Ebola, malaria or any number of common diseases in the area. Rapid results can also help doctors manage the care of sick people more easily. Internet aid WHO was able to track possible Ebola cases in nonaffected countries with the help of a 'dedicated internet search engine.' The system combs through the web for rumors and hints suggesting an Ebola case and can translate from many languages. From mid-October to year's end, the system picked up more than 183,000 alerts that were then screened by epidemiologists. More than 150 required further investigation. An unacceptable difference More than 70 percent of Ebola patients treated in West Africa died compared to a 26 percent death rate for foreign medical staff who were evacuated to countries with specialized treatment. WHO calls this difference 'unacceptable.'",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
3096042,ebola,SLE,1/15/2015 23:47,1," Last week, the ex-BB15 housemate was struck by a vomiting attack in which he threw up blood. A dream holiday turned into a living nightmare after the Manchester heartthrob was even put in quarantine after doctors feared he was contagious. Speaking exclusively to Daily Star Online, Ash revealed he fell ill while abroad in Egypt as foreign doctors battled to cure him for three days. He explained: 'The pain was unreal, my stomach was cramping up, but no one could tell me what was wrong. 'They jabbed me full of injections, I've no idea what they were, and had to put my trust in them.' Unable to help, Ash eventually caught a flight back to the UK. Yet like something out of a Liam Neeson film, the 26-year-old nearly sent the plane on diversion with an early landing as his condition worsened in the skies. Ash said: 'It was a six-hour flight and as the journey went on I got more and more disorientated. I was collapsing and all the people on the plane were looking after me. 'When we landed at the airport, I was rushed to hospital but there was a five-hour wait.' He continued: 'I went home and was vomiting up blood, that's why they thought it was Ebola. 'I rang the NHS hotline to explain everything and the nurse said, 'Right, we need to get you to A&E.' 'Soon as they heard I had blood coming out of me they panicked, her voice sounded like, 'Sh*t, he's a goner! He could die.' 'When the ambulance arrived, the paramedics were fully kitted out in plastic suits and masks, they came in looking like fishmongers.' With Ash's state deteriorating, the emergency doctors had to phone around to see which hospital would take him in quarantine. He was then rushed to Royal Bolton Hospital where they did tests and after an excruciating wait was finally given the all clear and instead diagnosed with a severe infection. Yet Ash's misery is still not over – as docs are unsure as to what the problem is. Helen Wood's BFF told us: 'It was genuinely horrendous, I didn't sleep for about 30 hours. I was given 10 different pills, five injections, and was on a drip as I lost a lot of blood. 'They're still not fully sure what it is, but they've taken blood samples and every other sample you can take! So we're just waiting on results. I'm being pumped with drugs in the meantime.' The Ebola death rate is currently at 8,500, with several UK citizens having been diagnosed. Loyal Helen stayed by Ash's side during his hospital dash, and despite her tough exterior, was in tears over what his doomed fate might be. Ash added: 'Helen was crying, thinking I was going to die. She was ringing my mum to tell her I'm in hospital with Ebola.' British nurse William Pooley contracted the virus while volunteering in West Africa, while Glaswegian nurse Pauline Cafferkey fell ill after returning from Sierra Leone. Had Ash in fact contracted Ebola, he could have been first Brit to die from the disease. Fortunately, the model is here to tell the tale. And flash that winning smile on the catwalk.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

Although then the scientific council of the Ministry of Health assessment is not due to the vaccine, but was created for mothers psychological problems for their children immunized, leading to consequences such as measles spread out this. He can tell the expression of measles? Assoc. Dr. Nguyen Dang Hien: Measles is divided into stages: incubation period, the child may have a fever from 38,5oC to 39oC. Phase discharge: This is the most contagious period, lasting from 3 to 5 days. There may be a febrile convulsion, accompanied fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain. At this stage the child has symptoms such as watery discharge, conjunctival redness, photophobia patients, the cornea and eyelids may be swollen, sneezing, runny nose, hoarseness. May cause laryngitis shrinkage, if any inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract dragon will cause diarrhea. Phase rash: Appears original, typical symptoms of soi.Ban appear sequentially in the ears first, then gradually spreads to 2 cheek, neck, chest, abdomen, back, abdomen, arms, and after 2 same as 2 feet. Measles red, with some initial combined together. Interspersed between the skin rash is healed. This is one of the distinctive signs with different kinds of rashes. Recovery phase: Measles flying sequence appears to the affected area of ​​skin black and blue marks on the skin surface, there mottle like tiger skin. When children suffer from measles should be treated as how to avoid complications? Assoc. Dr. Nguyen Dang Hien: Parents should regularly wash, dental hygiene for children, instead of gas, mattresses, clothing to ensure hygiene for children; Lau for young people daily with clean towels, soft; Isolation young children in the room airy and light, avoid drafts. During the period of measles, children should eat liquid food, but enough to digestible nutrients. When measles, children are more prone to dehydration due to vomiting, diarrhea and increased urination, so the water must be compensated by the child to drink plenty of water. Parents need to pay attention to the expression of the disease. Measles is a disease caused by a virus, there is no medication that primarily treat symptoms such as fever, fever medication for children. If the child can see the strange expression, the need to take the child to the hospital for the doctor visits and treatment guidelines. Complications of measles has not worry, sir? Assoc. Dr. Nguyen Dang Hien: Measles is a benign disease but yet to lead to complications, it has become very worrying. Because measles in persons with weakened immune systems should normally associated with measles after multiple infections and a variety of conditions in a very dangerous complication of measles medicine was recorded as subacute sclerosis brain. In particular, this year measles complications caused strange respiratory distress quickly. When children with measles are vulnerable to multiple infections should be clean, especially the mouth, nose, eye socket, on the skin. Without good hygiene is very susceptible to infection by the ancient instrument called Noma. That is, multiple infections were oral cavity causing gingivitis, stomatitis after maxillofacial skeleton deformation, distortion of the mouth. Children were vaccinated against measles with no risk? Assoc. Dr. Nguyen Dang Hien: Theoretically when children were fully vaccinated against measles will not be infected. However, there are rare cases where the child is vaccinated but still sick. Because in fact, any vaccine, measles vaccine does not own nor 100% preventable disease because it depends on many factors such as the location and preservation of vaccines ... Currently, the Ministry of Health recommends each Children should get two shots of measles vaccine. Nose head when the child is 9 months and two noses when they are 18 months old. For the children were fully vaccinated two shots so then the mother not to worry and do not need to inject more. Ministry of Health advocates of children from 9 months to two years of age have not been vaccinated and did not get all the nose will be two additional injections at the center of preventive medicine. According to Dr. Nguyen Dang Hien, now the Ministry of Health is conducting measles vaccine coverage for children from 9 months old, so the children under 9 months of age should also be at risk for measles vaccination is not. Meanwhile, reality, measles vaccine has been tested clinically safe for children 6 months and older. If evolution is complicated measles, may Center will be recommended to vaccinate children 6 months. So, can reduce the incidence of measles higher.

And they're turning to hundreds of dorm-dwelling freshmen this XXXXXX &nbsp; Technology, Discovery & Innovation September 23, 2009 7:17AM The study could shed crucial new light on how flu ripples through communities. Using sophisticated mapping techniques, researchers will tease out social aspects of infection -- how close you must be to the sick to catch their bug, for example. And they may identify hot spots where they can warn students to take extra precautions. Latest News Coughed on by somebody with the flu? Duke University researchers are developing a test to determine -- with a mere drop of blood -- who will get sick before the sniffling and fever set in. And they're turning to hundreds of dorm-dwelling freshmen this fall to see if it works. It's a novel experiment: Students report daily whether they have any cold or flu symptoms. If they do, a team swoops in to test not just the sneezer but, more importantly, seemingly healthy friends and hallmates who might be incubating the infection. 'We're redefining the definition of being ill,' says Col. Geoffrey Ling, a physician with the Defense Research Projects Agency, the Defense Department's research arm, which came up with the idea. The reason: The military faces huge problems when flu or other viruses sweep through crowded barracks, and knowing an outbreak was brewing could allow them to separate and protect those not infected. We're not just talking about the challenge of replacing fevered soldiers on the day's patrol. Your body may be slowing down even before that fever erupts, as it tries to fight off a brewing virus. And flu is contagious up to 24 hours before people show symptoms, one of the insidious ways that it spreads. 'If you've got a group of people living together and you can identify who's likely to become sick, you can much more efficiently use whatever your intervention is -- a vaccine, an antiviral -- to prevent disease,' explains Duke infectious disease specialist Dr. Christopher Woods. Respiratory viruses sweep through crowded college dorms just as easily as military squads, and with the new swine flu -- the 2009 H1N1 strain -- targeting mostly the young, Duke scientists may learn sooner than they had hoped just how well their experimental test really works. It's based on a simple principle: Your immune system revs up to fight infection long before you show symptoms or before today's tests could detect the actual virus in your body. The Duke team discovered a so-called genomic fingerprint, a pattern of subtle molecular changes as genes are activated to fight viral respiratory infections. Working with colleagues at the University of Virginia and in London, the Duke team first dripped various viruses into the noses of healthy volunteers. The people were quarantined, and scientists collected daily blood, saliva and nasal-fluid samples. Sure enough, they spotted the RNA-based fingerprint that separated who got sick from who didn't, in a few cases just hours after the person was exposed.

Hundreds of DOD personnel are in Liberia laying the groundwork for a U.S. military mission to fight the outbreak that the World Health Organization estimates has killed more than 3,400 people. Thousands of U.S. soldiers are scheduled to arrive this month to build treatment centers and oversee logistics. The humanitarian mission is likely to cost about $750 million over the coming sixth months, Gen. David Rodriguez said. Defense officials have repeatedly said troops have no contact with disease sufferers, but Rodriguez said Tuesday that a few military infectious disease specialists would be working with contaminated blood samples in the mobile labs. “This is not just medical guys trained to do this [particular task], this is what they do for a living,” he said. One such lab has been operational in Liberia for years, while two more were recently deployed. DOD now is working to send four more labs, he said — each operated by three or four technicians — needed because Ebola symptoms can mimic other tropical diseases, such as malaria. “The testing really focuses on who you need to treat and who you don’t need to treat, because malaria shows a similar problem with the symptoms,” he said. Making sure U.S. personnel don’t catch Ebola is priority No. 1, Rodriguez said. “By providing predeployment training, adhering to strict medical protocols while deployed, and carrying out carefully planned reintegration measures based on risk and exposure, I am confident that we can ensure our servicemembers’ safety, and the safety of their families and the American people,” he said. While deployed, troops will use safety clothing and equipment and wash constantly to prevent the virus spreading. They’ll also be checked for symptoms throughout the day, Rodriguez promised. Should anyone come down with the virus, they’ll be evacuated to the United States for treatment on a specially equipped medical transport plane. The Army has announced 3,200 soldiers from various units around the United States would deploy, with the potential for up to 4,000 troops to be sent. Most of those deployed will live at the Liberian defense ministry and in tent cities at airfields or elsewhere, Rodriguez said.

Business and political leaders say the virus is making overseas partners nervous and in some cases hurting bottom lines. “The investors generally have all been concerned,” said Peter Sullivan, chief executive officer of Australia’s Resolute Mining Ltd., which mines for gold in Mali, bordering Ebola-stricken Guinea. “For some of them, what you find is a degree of speculation on you being impacted significantly as a result of any outbreak.” No country has felt the psychological impact of the disease more than Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation. With a gross domestic product of more than $500 billion, it registered 20 cases and eight deaths. Although Nigeria was yesterday declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization, with no new cases since Sept. 8, the stigma lingers. Event Canceled The Bobby Taylor Company, a Lagos-based communications firm, had to cancel an event for about 150 music aficionados from the U.S., Nigeria and South Africa late last month over Ebola fears. “Lagos being Ebola-free is definitely something we can boast about but there’s still that twang of concern for people, the stigma that comes with us getting it in the first place,” said CEO Bukky Karibi-Whyte. “How do you really convince someone that the disease won’t touch them?” Ebola’s effects have reached the pinnacle of Nigeria’s corporate world, which is seeking international investment to refurbish ports, build power plants and erect waterfront skyscrapers for Lagos’s burgeoning upper classes. Dangote Group, the Lagos-based business empire controlled by billionaire Aliko Dangote, last month scrapped a planned visit by international investors to cement and sugar factories in and around the city. Some had said they were worried about Ebola. The trip hasn’t been rescheduled.Dangote declined further comment. Lengthy Recovery Many overseas organizations “fail to distinguish between high and low risk areas and the whole of West Africa has suffered as a result,” said Charles Laurie, the head of Africa at Bath, England-based risk consulting firm Maplecroft. For that reason, he said, “economic recovery for the region will, in all likelihood, be a lengthy process.” The three countries still battling the virus -- Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia -- together have a gross domestic product smaller than Afghanistan’s and are crowded together in the far western edge of the 4,500-mile-wide continentThat may not stop investors unfamiliar with the diversity of Africa’s 54 distinct countries from responding disproportionately to negative news. “Psychology plays a huge role and this has taken on a life of its own,” said Michael Marshall, whose Atago Pacific Partners advises on investments in sub-Saharan Africa. “Our long-term investment is not interrupted. The numbers, demographics and all the things that have made Africa compelling are still the case.” Worst-Hit Region In the short term, the damage is being felt both next door to the worst-hit region and further afield, the World Bank said in a report this month trying to quantify the overall economic impact of the epidemic. Senegal, which the WHO last week said was Ebola-free, and Ivory Coast, which has had no cases, are losing trade by closing their borders with affected countries, for instanceIn Gambia, a tourist-dependent nation of picturesque beaches and palm trees surrounded by Senegal, hotel bookings are down by 65 percent due to fear of the virus, the report said. Gambia’s geographic misfortune: being located within a few hundred kilometers of Senegal’s border with Guinea. In Lagos, a metropolis of more than 20 million, early reports from malls and shops “indicate significant recent declines in demand, sometimes in the range of 20 to 40 percent,” the Washington-based lender said. All told, the bank estimates, a worst-case Ebola scenario could knock about $33 billion off of the region’s GDP, an estimated $750 billion for 2014, by the end of next year.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
194995,influenza,USA,5/11/2009 11:48,NA,"School District has a Crisis Management Plan outlining procedures in case an emergency situation occurs. Included in the 53-page document are steps to follow if there is a medical incident, such as a flu outbreak. While district officials hope they'll never have to use the plan, they are addressing any concern there may be over the H1N1 Novel virus infection swine flu identified in some Minnesota school-aged children. On Monday, more than 1,100 flyers were sent out to parents and guardians of students in the district. It's to reassure them we are in contact with state education officials and the Department of Health. I have been working on it says Sharon Hoyt, the district's licensed school nurse. Although state health officials have not recommended any schools be closed, at least five have voluntarily called off classes so far. Superintendent Dale Brandsoy says Hoyt is working closely with Connie Leland, community health coordinator for Faribault and Martin counties, and with local medical authorities. â€œWeâ€™re keeping an eye on it and have a plan in place if something should happen,â€ says Brandsoy. The flyer outlines basic infection prevention measures for staff and students to follow. Two websites providing updated information on the flu virus also are listed. Hoyt says people may have symptoms that are similar to seasonal influenza that include a fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Brandsoy says district officials are turning to the Minnesota Department of Health for any guidelines they need to follow. They are the ones that will advise the district what to do. They are the experts he says. Anyone who is sick, says Hoyt, should stay home and contact a local clinic to make an appointment. United South Central interim Superintendent John Widvey says he has met with the school nurse and principals to discuss what to do. He says officials are responding to any questions the district's patrons may have on a case by case basis. We're trying to respond in an appropriate manner, yet not do something to create a panic situation says Widvey. We've decided let's keep our ears to the ground, in terms of working with state Department of Education and Health officials he adds. A news release issued by Leland states United Hospital District and Clinics is working with the South Central Healthcare Systems Preparedness Program and other local health care leaders to coordinate strategic efforts in response to the outbreak of the swine flu. Because H1N1 is resembling the more regular, seasonal flu, school officials are being allowed to close at their discretion based on an assessment of their own situation. Standard recommendations for preventing the spread of the flu virus include: Cover your nose and mouth with your sleeve when you cough or sneeze; Clean you hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub solution; Limit your contact with others who may be ill; Clean your hands after shaking hands or having close contact with other people â€” before eating or preparing food, or touching your eyes, nose or mouth.",NA,NA,0,,,,,,,

Kanayo Nwanze, president of International Fund for Agricultural Development, told a news conference Monday there are already food shortages in Senegal and other countries in West Africa because regional trade has been disrupted.

2758601,ebola,SLE,9/8/2014 17:58,NA,"A fourth American who contracted Ebola in West Africa was expected to arrive in the U.S. for care Tuesday and will be treated at an Atlanta hospital where two other aid workers successfully recovered from the disease, the hospital said Monday. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. James Wilson said the patient, as in past cases, would be flown into Dobbins Air Reserve Base outside Atlanta. Emory University Hospital said in a news release that the patient would be treated in its isolation unit but cited confidentiality in not releasing more information about the person. The World Health Organization, however, said one of its doctors working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the disease. It said the doctor was in stable condition Monday in Freetown and will be evacuated. The State Department said the doctor was from the U.S. Last month, two aid workers who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia were treated successfully at Emory. A third patient, an American doctor, who is being treated in Nebraska, appeared to be better tolerating his experimental treatments Monday, but his recovery remains uncertain. The family of Dr. Rick Sacra said he was able to eat breakfast Monday for the first time since arriving Friday at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. The 51-year-old remains in stable condition. His wife, Debbie, said Sacra is more alert and that they had a half-hour conversation by video conference Sunday. 'He hasn't been able to eat much since he got here, but he had some toast and apple sauce,' Debbie Sacra said. 'He also tolerated the research drug well — better than he had the previous doses he was given.' Rick Sacra, a doctor from Worcester, Massachusetts, spent 15 years working at the Liberia hospital where he fell ill. He was practicing family medicine in Liberia with the North Carolina-based charity SIM. Authorities say roughly 2,100 people have died during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, but Ebola hasn't been confirmed as the cause of all those deaths. Sacra is getting a different experimental drug than the one used for the two American aid workers treated earlier at Emory. Nancy Writebol, who also worked for the SIM mission, and Dr. Kent Brantly, who worked for another missionary group, Samaritan's Purse, in Liberia, have recovered. Sacra went to Omaha instead of Atlanta because federal officials asked the medical center to treat him in order to prepare other isolation units to take more Ebola patients if needed. Sacra's doctors have refused to name the drug they are using, but they say they've been consulting with Ebola experts on his treatment. Dr. Aneesh Mehta of Emory University said Monday that it was impossible to know if the experimental ZMapp drug that Brantly and Writebol received worked. But Mehta said Emory doctors have been advising other physicians that some particular types of supportive care did seem to help. Those included switching between different types of IV fluids to meet each patient's specific electrolyte needs at the time. And giving high-quality liquid nutrition to boost their levels of protein and other nutrients 'to help build back that immune system that was under attack.' Mehta and other experts were discussing Ebola at the American Society for Microbiology meeting Monday. Pharmaceutical companies are developing vaccines for Ebola and drugs to help treat the virus, but they're not fully tested or readily available yet. Dr. Gary Kobinger of the Public Health Agency of Canada helped pioneer the research that led to ZMapp, and he said the U.S. manufacturer appears to be on track for a Phase 1 safety study early next year, perhaps as early as January, although no drug is available currently. On the vaccine front, Kobinger said a Canadian-made candidate should be starting Phase 1 trials within weeks. WHO has suggested turning to the blood of Ebola survivors as an experimental treatment, and Sacra's doctors have said they are considering that. ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2911770,ebola,USA,10/29/2014 7:35,0,"Federal clarity about Ebola quarantine policy eluded President Obama on Tuesday, as he sought in a hastily arranged statement to both reassure Americans and postpone answers about why the Pentagon, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as key states apply different limitations on the movement of those entering the United States from West African epicenters of the virus. As he departed the White House for Milwaukee to begin his maiden campaign swing with candidates one week before Election Day, Obama told reporters he’d elaborate Wednesday. The president touted the virtues of medical science and “smart decisions,” appearing to implicitly rebuke New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who imposed a mandatory 21-day quarantine in health facilities on health care workers returning from West Africa through his state. Christie relaxed that decision in order to release Doctors Without Borders nurse Kaci Hickox, who had been confined in a hospital over the weekend without symptoms of illness before being transferred to her home in Maine on Monday. Christie, campaigning through Florida and Maryland this week, said he did not back down, adding that CDC quarantine guidelines are “wrong.” Obama announced his intention to meet doctors and public health workers on their way to West Africa and others returning from battling Ebola as a way to underscore “how our policies can support the incredible heroism that they are showing.” The president appeared to embrace the U.S. Army’s order to quarantine personnel returning from Africa, even though those personnel did not provide Ebola patient care, and despite the clash with CDC guidelines. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is weighing a recommendation from the Joint Chiefs of Staff for “a regimented program of 21 days of controlled, supervised monitoring for all troops returning from Ebola response efforts in West Africa,” Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Tuesday. Hagel backs the Army’s quarantine decision, which was announced Monday. Obama has committed up to 4,000 U.S. troops to West Africa to erect 17 field hospitals and coordinate responses in the region. The president endorsed separate Pentagon Ebola standards, even if troops returning to the United States provided no direct patient care and had no contact with Ebola-infected body fluids. “The military is in a different situation, obviously, because they are, first of all, not treating patients. Second of all, they are not there voluntarily,” he told reporters. “We don’t expect to have similar rules for our military as we do for our civilians.” Obama said he’d have a better explanation Wednesday. “I’ll have more about -- more to say about this tomorrow.” The CDC says quarantining or impeding the free movement of returning health workers who have a low or negligible risk of Ebola exposure and no symptoms of illness is not advised because it is unnecessary, burdensome and could discourage caregivers from volunteering in West Africa, where their skills are in desperate need. Health care workers and humanitarian volunteers have warned they would face hurdles with leave time and compensation from their jobs if they had to account for three weeks of mandatory hospital isolation when they return to the United States after serving in Africa. Amended CDC guidelines say health monitoring should be tailored to the individual exposure risks and circumstances of each returning caregiver. Many of those workers, including Hickox, complain that stigmatizing them and substituting political fears for scientific facts hinder the call-to-medical-arms seen as critical in West Africa, thus increasing the chances that the Ebola outbreak spreads on the African continent and globally. “We don’t want to discourage our health care workers from going to the front lines and dealing with this in an effective way,” Obama said.

3094264,ebola,ARE,1/15/2015 8:30,0,"Following its detection in the 1970s in Zaire, Ebola virus only affected neighbouring countries until the 2014 outbreak in Guinea, spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone and claiming its highest number of victims. The first case of Ebola was reported in August 1976 in the Yambuku District of Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), by Dr. Peter Piot, a Belgian microbiologist, who currently heads the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and a team of infectious disease experts. The outbreak occurred near the Ebola River, earning the virus its name. A second outbreak, called Sudan Ebola virus, occurred in Sudan between June and November 1976. While the spread of the earlier virus was contained within a 70km radius of Yambuku, the Sudan Ebola virus spread across four towns – Nzara and Maridi, which saw the most cases, and Tembura and Juba. A 1978 report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) states that the 1976 Zaire Ebola virus, in which 318 people were infected and 280 died, began at the Yakubu Mission Hospital, after a patient was treated for what was then thought to be malaria. Eleven out of the 17 hospital staff died in that outbreak. Though the Ebola virus strains in the DRC and Sudan are the most common, there are three others: Reston virus (which is not infectious to humans), Taï Forest virus and Bundibugyo virus. The Zaire strain, which has up to 90% fatality rate, is the one currently ravaging Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where more than 6,000 people have died, as of December 2014. In November, there was another unrelated Ebola outbreak in the DRC, where a pregnant woman was infected after eating bush meat. About 67 cases and 49 deaths were reported in the DRC as of November 2014. The death toll in the DRC from all prior outbreaks combined stands at more than 1,590. ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2715308,ebola,NGA,8/22/2014 19:05,NA,"The World Health Organization, in its Aug. 22 Ebola situation statement, reported that there had been 142 new illnesses reported in the two days between Aug. 19 and 20. Liberia reported 110 new cases alone. In addition, the outbreak in Nigeria changed for the worse. Liberia has now reported the largest number of Ebola illnesses in the West African outbreak as well as the highest death toll. Through Aug. 20, the country reports 1,082 confirmed, probable or suspected Ebola cases and 624 deaths. The total from the four nations reporting illnesses is 2,615 cases and 1,427 deaths. In an assessment released Aug. 22, the WHO noted that they were encountering behaviors that had never been seen in previous Ebola outbreaks. The opening of a new treatment center is being greeted with the appearance of a host of new patients, few of which had previously been identified as at risk. The WHO believes that this is a sign of 'an invisible caseload of patients.' The WHO also describes the existence of 'shadow zones.' These are regions in the country that are very difficult to reach, or where there has been active community resistance to public health efforts. Rumors are emerging from these zones, leading to a strong suspicion that there are a great number of Ebola cases that have not been discovered. In the capital of Liberia, Monrovia, the situation is grim. The WHO states that 'virtually all health services have shut down.' The agency notes the looting of a clinic in a Monrovia slum on Aug. 16. The slow spread of Ebola in Nigeria continues. Nigeria was brought to the capital, Lagos, by a Liberian-American named Patrick Sawyer. Since his arrival, illness and death, a number of people who had contact with him have developed Ebola and four have died. The first secondary infections have been diagnosed in two spouses of the original patients infected by Sawyer. The WHO and the Nigerian government differ in their reported data. Including Patrick Sawyer, the WHO reports a total of 16 Ebola illnesses and five deaths. The Nigerians report 14 cases with five deaths. There are four patients in isolation and five patients have been released from the hospital. The Nigerian authorities have a number of individuals under surveillance who are either contacts of Sawyer or contacts of the others who contracted Ebola from him. While the containment effort appears to be working at this time, there may be additional illnesses and deaths in the group being monitored. Thus far, there is no sign the illness has moved into the general population.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

Lake County General Health District hosted a clinic Nov. 15 in Willoughby with assistance from the city's school district, fire XXXXXX H1N1 clinic in Mentor Sunday Published: Friday, November 20, 2009 Authorities are hoping for better attendance at the H1N1 vaccine clinic Sunday at the Mentor School of Fine Arts Center. Lake County General Health District hosted a clinic Nov. 15 in Willoughby with assistance from the city's school district, fire department and Lake County Emergency Management Agency. They hoped to vaccinate 5,000 people and were prepared for as many as 9,000. Only 2,428 vaccinations were given. Authorities were surprised by the low turnout. Consequently, Lake County Health Commissioner Joel Lucia wanted to say that anyone in the five priority groups could come to the Mentor School of Fine Arts for a vaccine Sunday between 9:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. The priority groups include pregnant women, caregivers for children younger than 6 months old, anyone between 6 months and 24 years of age, people between the ages of 25 and 64 who have health conditions associated with higher risk of medical complications from influenza, and health-care and EMS personnel. Lucia stressed that people may come to the clinic regardless of where they are from. The vaccinations are free. &quot;The more people we get the H1N1 vaccine to, the less likely there is to be illness and death,&quot; he said. Lucia suggested people come after 12:30 p.m. when lines are expected to be shorter. A reverse 911 call will go out to residents of Mentor, Mentor-on-the-Lake, Kirtland Hills, Kirtland and Waite Hill, reminding them of the clinic.

2860374,ebola,GIN,10/13/2014 19:00,3,"President Barack Obama called for immediate steps to ensure the United States medical system is ready to follow the proper protocol for treating Ebola patients. Obama spoke on Sunday with Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell about the first case of Ebola transmission in the United States. Obama ordered the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to quickly investigate how a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital contracted the virus. The nurse was part of the team treating the first Ebola patient to be diagnosed in the United States, Thomas Duncan, who died last week. Texas officials say the health worker wore full protective gear and complied with CDC guidelines when she had contact with Duncan. CDC Director Tom Frieden said the fact the worker was infected with Ebola shows there was a breach of protocol. Frieden said, at this time, it appears only one person may have had contact with the health care worker while she may have been infectious. However, the case in Texas indicated a professional lapse that may have caused other health workers at the hospital to also be infected, he added. Initial testing showed that the level of virus in the worker’s system is low. The CDC will conduct a secondary test to confirm the results from a lab in Austin that showed Ebola infection, he said. “Unfortunately it is possible in the coming days that we will see additional cases of Ebola,” Frieden added. A union for registered nurses said the Texas health care worker’s case in Dallas showed that not enough is being done to educate health workers on how to manage patients who show signs of infection. “Handing out a piece of paper with a link to the Centers for Disease Control, or telling nurses just to look at the CDC website - as we have heard some hospitals are doing - is not preparedness,” said Bonnie Castillo, a registered nurse and senior official with National Nurses United. Meanwhile, Liberia on Monday faced a nationwide walkout by healthcare workers demanding danger money to care for Ebola patients, in an epidemic that has already killed dozens of their colleagues. The strike threat came as the United States scrambled to find out how a Texan healthcare worker contracted the tropical virus, in the first case of contamination on US soil. The new infection dealt a blow to global efforts to stem an outbreak that has claimed more than 4,000 lives, most of them in the west African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone and the hardest-hit, Liberia, AFP reported. Monday’s strike call in Liberia came in defiance of an official request to avoid industrial action during the Ebola crisis, which has killed more than 2,300 in Liberia and overwhelmed its skeletal health service. The chairman of the Liberian health workers’ union, Joseph Tamba, said the walkout concerned “every hospital and every health centre including ETUs (Ebola Treatment Units).” Healthcare workers are on the frontline of the worst outbreak on record of Ebola, which spreads through contact with bodily fluids, with 95 killed in Liberia alone, according to the World Health Organisation. With monthly salaries said to be as low as $250 (200 euros) a month, calls are mounting for pay commensurate to the acute risk of dealing with Ebola, for which there is no vaccine or widely-available treatment. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf acknowledged as much last week, telling a World Bank crisis meeting there was an urgent need for “compensation to healthcare workers who, for fear of the risk involved, have refused or are reluctant to return to work”. Staff at Island Clinic, the largest government-run Ebola clinic in the Liberian capital Monrovia, have been on a “go slow” since Friday for extra pay.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

Some parents kept their children out of school after Bridgewater-Raynham officials sent out the first of two &#8220;instant alerts&#8221; to parents about the flu cases on Oct. 13. , however, &#8220;the absentee rate was normal for this time of year,&#8221; LaLiberte Principal Dennis Bray said. Four students at LaLiberte Elementary School were confirmed with the Influenza A, generally considered to be H1N1 or swine flu. A Raynham Middle School fifth-grader was believed to be sick with the same virus and a trio of LaLiberte teachers stayed out or went home sick with flu-like symptoms. B-R Superintendent Jacqueline Forbes said there had been a few isolated cases of suspected H1N1 &#8220;throughout the district.&#8221; The sudden cluster in a single school prompted the alert, she said. Parents would only be notified of &#8220;major developments&#8221; that would impact their children&#8217;s health and education, she said in a third alert. Raynham may have reported the cases to parents but area children are also falling ill with H1N1, health professionals at Morton Hospital and Medical Center say. The sick children have come from the hospital&#8217;s &#8220;catch area,&#8221; including Taunton, Dighton, Rehoboth, Raynham and Middleboro, said Connie Schmidt, infection control nurse at Morton Hospital. The cases have more than doubled each week over the past two weeks. &#8220;It&#8217;s out there in all the communities,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a significant increase in the number of cases of virus and Influenza A.&#8221; Dr. Peter Bosco said the emergency room has confirmed at least seven patients testing positive for Influenza A, mostly among infants to young teenagers. A 7-month-old was released from the hospital after the baby was brought in. An 11-month-old was transferred to Children&#8217;s Hospital in Boston as a precaution, he said. &#8220;The problem with this strain of influenza is we haven&#8217;t seen it since 1976 so the herd immunity in this age group is low,&#8221; he said. Bosco, who serves on the hospital&#8217;s pandemic disease control committee for Bristol County, said he expects to see an uptake in the number of cases over the next couple of weeks. The hospital has vaccinated high-risk personnel such as emergency room and obstetrical workers. It takes about three weeks to build up a full immunity to swine flu. &#8220;We are as prepared as we can be in this situation,&#8221; he said. Based on cases in the south, the hospital is anticipating an upswing here. So far, the hospital has been able to keep up with the demand for services. &#8220;We have a surge plan in effect but we have not had to use it,&#8221; Schmidt said. Dr. Kenny Berlin has seen a few cases of suspected swine flu cases in his Raynham pediatric practice, including two seriously ill children. Although the standard treatment remains the same &#8211; Tylenol, Motrin, plenty of fluids and rest &#8211; Berlin urges parents of all sick patients to come in to be tested if they have a fever to rule out strep throat or pneumonia. His waiting room is not swamped &#8211; not yet. &#8220;It might be different in a month,&#8221; he says. He received some vaccine and is awaiting more. He encourages all his patients to get vaccinated, including his own three children aged 16 to 21. It&#8217;s a race against the clock, he says. &#8220;The vaccine is safe. It&#8217;s made by the same manufacturer in the same plants as the regular flu vaccine,&#8221; he said. Swine flu outbreaks were first reported in the United States this spring. In June, a total of 19 students and a teacher at the Raynham Middle School were suspected of contracting the swine flu after a field trip into Boston. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has stopped tracking town-by-town incidents of swine flu and no longer tests for swine flu, assuming most cases are H1N1, spokeswoman Jennifer Manley said. The DPH is also not recommending closing schools because it disrupts learning. &#8220;Even if 20 percent of the students are sick, 80 percent are not,&#8221; she said. LaLiberte is also going ahead with two of its most popular gatherings this month, the Harvest Fair on Oct. 24 and the Gala International Buffet on Oct. 30, Bray said. School officials ask parents to keep their children home if they have a fever, sore throat, aching joints, cough and a runny nose. A child must also be free of a fever of 100 degrees and be off medications for at least 24 hours before returning to school. Public health officials encourage those at greatest risk for H1N1 &#8211; from 6 months to 24 years, individuals who care for children under the age of 6 months, pregnant women and people with chronic underlying health conditions, such as asthma or diabetes &#8211; to get vaccinated first. More vaccine is expected from the federal government each week.

2937471,ebola,SLE,11/7/2014 11:56,0,"HUISH Park will host an African Ebola awareness event later this month. It is being run on Tuesday, November 18 by international charity Save the Children and will feature first-hand accounts of how Liberia has been affected by the disease. Guest speaker for the charity Judith Ezzard has been to Liberia recently and has seen the damage Ebola has caused. She will share her experiences in an attempt to increase people’s understanding and highlight the seriousness of the crisis. Since March, the virus has affected at least 6,000 people across west Africa and killed more than 3,000. The true number of those affected, however, is thought to be much greater as not all cases have been reported, tested, or diagnosed.

The Centers for Disease Control has advised officials at Providence Milwaukie Hospital that no further testing is required. Officials said Friday that the woman had no known contact with anyone affected with the virus and was considered a low risk for contracting the disease. Tri-County Health Officer Dr. Paul Lewis says officials are satisfied that the system worked well. The patient is still in the hospital, but officials citing privacy concerns would not release any further information about her condition or when she will be released. Officials say the woman had recently been in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone and was staying in Portland. She was taken to the hospital in the Portland suburb of Milwaukie.

1066362,hfm,SGP,3/9/2012 23:14,0,"The number of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases among children is steadily increasing - with 1,119 children coming down with the viral infection just last week. The figure is almost four times higher than the last five years' median of 319 cases and is 50 per cent more than the 780-per-week number required for a disease to be considered an epidemic threat. The 780-per-week mark was reached in mid-February and has since steadily increased. According to The Straits Times, the last time the number of cases crossed 1,000 a week was at the end of August 2010. Ministry of Health (MOH) yesterday ordered two more childcare centres to close because of the spread of HFMD cases among its children. Little Footies in Serangoon Gardens and Pat's Schoolhouse in Meyer Road are the latest among eight childcare centres and kindergartens forced to be shut so far this year. Another 10 are on the watchlist. MOH gives the order when childcare centres or kindergartens have more than 16 HFMD cases, or when more than 23 per cent of its children are infected for more than 24 days. When told to shut, the centres must close for 10 days in an attempt to break the chain of transmission. HFMD, which commonly affects children, can cause symptoms such as fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers and blisters on palms and feet. These last between four and five days, and a child will be well enough to return to school after nine days. There is no vaccine or medication to prevent or cure the viral infection. An MOH spokesman told the English daily that the current epidemic stems from the Coxsackievirus - different from Enterovirus 71 (EV71). The more dangerous strain, EV71, can cause serious illness and was responsible for the death of a child here in 2008. MOH stressed that it is most concerned when EV71 as it is known to be associated with potentially serious complications. While the ministry's surveillance shows that there is not much activity from this strain yet, MOH says it will continue to monitor the situation. ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

At the same time, to review the injection of other vaccines in immunization programs expand that coverage is low. This is the request of the Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam in the online conference with 63 provinces and for the prevention and control of measles outbreaks in the morning and 23.2. Inject many stars still outbreak? Measles immunization coverage in Hanoi was informed that reaches 95-99%. However, Nguyen Khac Hien - Director of the Hanoi Department of Health - said: This year has recorded 159 cases of measles in 114 communes in all 29 districts. In the future, Hanoi still need about 60,000 nose measles immunization, which involves injecting a small part ""suit"" - that is given to him beyond the age of vaccination (from 9-18 months of age), but have not been vaccinated. Hanoi is a proof that 'hole' of immunity against measles. The incidents related to recent vaccination has caused concern about people putting their children go injections. However, the Minister of Health said: Can measles outbreaks have had the germ from before, not only in 2012 - 2013 to present. There have been times when medical staff go boats, canoes in the villages, hamlets to vaccinate children. Thus, the expanded immunization program should consider organizing mobile vaccination teams in villages not to be missed injections, especially in the northern provinces, the largest city, the province has a low rate of immunization . Must fill 'gaps' of measles immunity! In Yen Bai, from the beginning of the year has recorded 323 cases of measles. Dr. Luong Van Hom - Director of the Department of Health Yen Bai province - said: 10.2013 Since last month, measles occurred in Mu Cang Chai district, Tram Tau; then spread to a number of communes in Van Chan, Nghia Lo. These patients are mainly ethnic Mongolian. There was a 3 year old child deaths from measles. Dr. Ha Thi Hong Thuy - BV Director General Nghia Lo area - where in the past 4 months has received nearly 250 cases of measles also stated this is unusual. Many patients with respiratory complications, pneumonia, diarrhea ... by detecting illness and hospitalization late. Meanwhile, the year before almost BV does not receive any cases of measles in the last dozen years has only 1-2 cases / year. When working with Yen Bai province, Minister of Health Nguyen Thi Kim Tien also requires the department should establish working groups to maneuver down to the village uplands to vaccination against measles, not to occur unfortunate incident like last time. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Tran Hien - Chairman of the expanded immunization program - said: ""The program has prepared 200,000 doses of vaccine for measles vaccination for children under 2 years of age have not been vaccinated according to schedule. This is the number of additional vaccine to an estimated population of over 4 million annual dose as planned.

The campaign is aimed at achieving zero Ebola infection comes December 31 of this year. The head of the Liberia Marketing Association has called on all marketers to join the fight against the Ebola virus by observing all the necessary preventive measures given by the Ministry of Health and its local and international partners. Madam Slong stressed that since the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, market women have been finding it difficult to carry out their daily activities something she described as troubling for them noting that most women have to sell in order to sustain their families. She said due to the Ebola outbreak in the country, market women are out of business and they have lost their incomes adding that the situation poses serious challenge to those market women who are single mothers with the initiative of providing for their children. The Liberia Marketing Association president noted that rural market women are mostly affected by the closure of various markets in the rural areas something she said made it difficult for those women to even have food on their tables since the outbreak of the virus. She added that' we are troubled because schools are about to reopen and most market women who are considered bread winners for their families are unable to do their regular business due to the virus outbreak which led to the closure of the markets.' Meanwhile, Madam Lusu Slong is urging young people to stay away from sex with strange person.

An overview of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where a separate, unrelated outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) is occurring, is also provided (see Annex 1). 1. COUNTRIES WITH WIDESPREAD AND INTENSE TRANSMISSION 7470 (probable, confirmed and suspected; see Annex 2) cases and 3431 deaths have been reported in the current outbreak of EVD up to the end of 1 October 2014 by the Ministries of Health of Guinea, and Sierra Leone, and up to the end of 30 September by the Ministry of Health of Liberia (table 1). Many of the deaths attributed to EVD in the present outbreak have occurred in people who were suspected, but not confirmed, EVD cases. EVD cases are only confirmed when a sample tests positive in the laboratory. If samples taken from a body test negative for EVD, that person is no longer counted among EVD deaths and the figures are adjusted accordingly. However, because laboratory services and treatment centres are currently overwhelmed, especially in Liberia, the numbers of probable and suspected cases, together with those confirmed, may be a more accurate reflection of case numbers. Work is also ongoing to resolve discrepancies between different sources of data, which may lead to a revision of the numbers of cases and deaths in the future. Figure 1 shows the location of cases throughout the countries with widespread and intense transmission. The cumulative numbers of cases of EVD are shown (grey circles). In Guinea, the district of Lola, which borders Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire, has reported its first two confirmed cases.Exposure of health-care workers (HCWs) to EVD continues to be an alarming feature of this outbreak. As of 1 October, 382 HCWs are known to have developed EVD (69 in Guinea, 188 in Liberia, 11 in Nigeria and 114 in Sierra Leone). 216 HCWs have died as a result of EVD infection (35 in Guinea, 94 in Liberia, five in Nigeria, 82 in Sierra Leone). 2. COUNTRIES WITH AN INITIAL CASE OR CASES, OR WITH LOCALIZED TRANSMISSION Three countries, Nigeria, Senegal, and the United States of America have now reported a case or cases imported from a country with widespread and intense transmission. In Nigeria, there have been 20 cases and eight deaths. In Senegal, there has been one case, but as yet there have been no deaths or further suspected cases attributable to Ebola (table 2). On 30 September 2014, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) was informed of the first confirmed imported case of EVD in the United States of America. The patient is an adult with recent travel history to West Africa who developed symptoms compatible with EVD on 24 September 2014, approximately 4 days after arriving in the United States of America. The patient sought medical care on 26 September 2014, and was admitted into isolation on 28 September 2014 at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Samples were sent for testing to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, and to the Texas state laboratory. Results were positive for Ebola virus.Contact tracing and follow-up is ongoing. In Nigeria, all 891 contacts have now completed 21-day follow-up (362 contacts in Lagos, 529 contacts in Port Harcourt). The date of isolation of the last confirmed case was 31 August (34 days ago). In Senegal, all contacts have now completed 21-day 4 follow-up, with no further cases of EVD reported. The single confirmed case in Senegal was isolated on 26 August (39 days ago).

Water-borne diseases such as typhoid and cholera have killed scores of people in Harare and surrounding areas in the past few years. Chinhoyi Town Council acting engineering services manager, Timothy Maregere said the situation was 'really bad' and council had no resources to address the problem. He however added that a German company, GZI, had promised to make available about US$400 000 for the upgrading of the sewer system and council was in the process of identifying companies that could undertake the project. But council director for health services, William Mayavo, played down the looming health crisis saying the water was safe because it was approved by experts accredited by government. 'Despite the continued sewer system problem in Chinhoyi, our water is safe as we send it to Harare every fortnight for double-checking to determine if it is safe for human consumption,' said Mayawo. He added that council was also 'retraining' its water analysts at Chinhoyi University of Technology. But chairman of Environmental Work, Planning and Management Ward 10 councillor, Tendayi Musonza concurred with Maregere saying the situation remained 'dire' as the sewer plant had not been functional for over a decade. 'These guys are misleading the residents,' said Musonza. 'The situation is far from over as GZI funds are covering the new Ruvimbo high density suburb, which is only a drop in an ocean.' Chinhoyi residents have always complained about the quality of water at every meeting they hold. Fears of disease outbreak in Chinhoyi come amid reports that the council was sitting on US$2,9 million for the sewer upgrade which it failed to use because of squabbles that arose over allegations of irregularities in the tender process. EMA slams council over sewer delays Environmental Management Agency (EMA) education and publicity manager Steady Kangata accused the council of delaying the addressing of the sewer problem in the town. 'We called Chinhoyi council for a hearing recently in connection with the health dangers likely to face residents of Chinhoyi,' said Kangata. 'Chances that an outbreak of water-borne diseases can occur are very high, especially to all those living in downstream areas.' He said council had promised to repair all pump stations that were not working but up to now they had not addressed the problem. Kangata said council must realise that people have the right to live in a clean, safe and healthy environment.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
3124393,ebola,SLE,1/27/2015 19:31,0,"(Nanowerk News) Health care workers must diagnose and isolate Ebola victims at an early stage to have a chance to save them and prevent the virus from spreading. But the most sensitive and quickest diagnostic test produces a small percentage of false negative results that undermine efforts to control the deadly agent. Case Western Reserve University researchers have been awarded a $100,000 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to--within a year--develop a method to reduce the risk of the virus going undetected. Different forms of Ebola virus have killed 25 percent to 90 percent of those who became infected, according to the World Health Organization. The current outbreak has left more than 8,400 dead in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to recent Centers for Disease Control figures. Among the dead are surgeon Martin Salia, whose family lives in Maryland. After he fell ill in Sierra Leone, an early test for the disease was negative. By the time he was flown to an Omaha, Neb., hospital for treatment in November, he was in advanced stages of the fast-moving disease and died soon after. 'While Ebola is declining in West Africa, there remains a strong risk of outbreaks in the future,' said Nicole Steinmetz, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve University. With no vaccine or cure on the horizon, the NSF sought proposals that could quickly improve the status quo. Steinmetz, the principal investigator of the grant and an appointee of the university's School of Medicine, is not an expert in human viruses, but has extensive experience in manipulating nanoparticle-sized plant viruses for the benefit of human health. The problem with the current method, called the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test, is that there is no reliable control available to ensure the target of the test is not being destroyed during processing. The test is designed to detect the presence of Ebola ribonucleic acid, RNA, a key component of the virus' molecular biology. To extract the viral RNA from the tissue for testing, health care workers have to process the tissues, and the target RNA may be destroyed during the harsh conditions of the assay. These processing errors may remain undetected, resulting in a false negative result. Steinmetz's lab plans to build a positive control through a bio-inspired nanomanufacturing protocol. The team will make a synthetic, safe form of the Ebola RNA and insert it in a plant virus nanoparticle. The plant virus has a protective protein coat similar to the Ebola virus coat that protects its RNA. This control will mimic Ebola virus realistically and can be added to test samples for detection and monitoring of the processing steps. The safe RNA will also include a type of marker that can be detected by enzymatic activity, as long as the RNA remains intact. Not detecting the marker at any point would indicate that the processing has degraded the plaint virus RNA and would have also degraded any Ebola virus RNA present, Steinmetz said. 'It tells us a mistake was made and the assay needs to be repeated to rule out a false negative result,' she said. Otherwise, the test could fail to detect the Ebola virus. Therefore, the patient might not be quarantined and treated, and those with whom the patient had close contact would not be tested. Working with Steinmetz will be Ruth Keri, a professor of pharmacology at the School of Medicine, and the University of Stuttgart's Christina Wege. As part of the project, the lab will develop a high-tech test to use in a clinic and a low-tech test for use in the field. 'For the low-tech assay, we'll need a different process where you don't have computers or refrigeration,' Steinmetz said. 'We hope to develop low-tech kits that can be taken to high-risk areas of Africa and be used to detect the disease earlier rather than waiting on U.S. or European health care workers to fly in and run diagnostics.'

2991468,ebola,USA,11/26/2014 9:01,0,"This Thanksgiving Day, 170 CDC disease detectives, public health experts, and communication specialists will not be home celebrating with loved ones. They’ll be in West Africa, working to contain the Ebola epidemic. Some of them are deep in remote areas, far from the home comforts we take for granted. Some are traveling on dangerous roads, by helicopter, and in dugout canoes to help stop outbreaks of Ebola. They do many critical things such as trace contacts so they can be isolated, and treated if necessary, to improve their survival and prevent spread of the epidemic. Others swelter in personal protective equipment to prepare blood samples for Ebola testing in mobile labs. Still others stay up late into the night poring over epidemiologic data to see where teams will need to be sent the next day. Our workers on the front lines are supported by hundreds of equally hard-working staff back in Atlanta who keep CDC’s Emergency Operations Center running 24/7. They’ve been working at full speed for more than four months, and will keep going until the job is done. Thousands of other equally dedicated CDC workers continue to protect Americans from other health threats, ranging from influenza to drug-resistant infections and more. And there are teams to jump in at a moment’s notice in the event there is another case of Ebola here in the United States. None of these extraordinarily dedicated women and men are strangers to work on holidays, weekends, or after-hours. They aren’t doing it to get rich or famous. And they won’t get thank-you letters from the millions of Americans and others around the world who won’t get sick or injured because of their work. Public health successes are usually invisible – the “dog that doesn’t bark in the night.” Please join me in recognizing them on this day of Thanksgiving.

3055035,ebola,NGA,12/25/2014 14:37,1,"Dr. Senga Omeonga met us under a huge mango tree outside the St. Joseph's Catholic Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia. Behind the main building, several dozens of disinfected rubber boots worn by health care workers were propped upside down on stakes planted on a patch of lawn. This is the hospital where he works as general surgeon and the head of Infection Prevention Control. It's also where he came down with Ebola on August 2. He says his days in treatment were 'a living hell.' And the experience has changed his view of the world — and the way he treats patients. Dr. Senga is from the Democratic Republic of Congo but came to the country four years ago. He's 53, married and has four children — two sons and two daughters. His family lives in Canada. He remembers how unprepared everyone was for the outbreak. Medical workers were touching patients with their bare hands in the early days. He himself treated a patient with a wound from a motorcycle accident. When the patient was later diagnosed with Ebola, Dr. Senga was quarantined. But he didn't catch the virus. Then he treated a sibling of Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian American who flew to Nigeria after contracting the Ebola virus and later died of the disease. And that, Dr. Senga says, is how he thinks he became one of Liberia's nearly 8,000 cases. Dr. Senga was one of the fortunate ones. He was taken to the Ebola treatment unit, or ETU, at the Eternal Love Winning Africa hospital. After several weeks, he recovered and is now back at work. He spoke with us about how Ebola nearly took his life — and how the experience changed his life and the way he practices medicine. You must have been very scared. Yeah, I was very, very scared. Knowing what Ebola is and the death rate ... the chance of survival was very, very low. Because I was vomiting, my only hope was to take as much as I can, the fluids, the orals. I was forcing myself. You mean the oral rehydration liquids to replenish lost fluids? Yeah. So I was taking that every day, at least four liters every day. I think they helped to keep me very well hydrated, even though I was vomiting, and I was very weak. And then, I was transferred to ETU. That was a very bad experience. A very, very bad experience. People were lying on the floor — no bed, very few [healthcare workers]. They come in the morning, maybe once a day. Describe the scene in the ETU. For one week I had my bed in the hallway. And you see everybody laying on the floor. They just gave us [a] mattress to put on the floor. At that time there was one toilet. But because a lot of people were using it — Ebola comes with the diarrhea — it overflowed and clogged. 'Poo poo' all over the floor. So when I wanted to use the bathroom, there was no way. We just stand at the door. [There was] no way to go in. What did you do? They were giving the people buckets. So everybody has a small bucket for vomit, for everything. You're living like a nonhuman. You get in a depression. And sometimes you can have your bucket with you for all day [with] nobody to empty it. So you live in this area; the smell is all over. Sometimes you don't even have food because nobody [can] come in, [there are] not enough PPEs [personal protective equipment] to give to the staff. And you can scream all day of hunger. That's how people were living in their ETU day in/day out. You can have food maybe once a day because nobody can come three times to give you the food. It sounds subhuman. Yes. A lot of people died because of lack of care inside the ETU. And they're dying around you. Every day. When you wake up in the morning, you see the person who was next to you is no longer there. There were a few discharges [of patients who were cured] at that time. The one who get discharged really was a big event. But it was just death, death, death, death. And you see people, they're very weak. And you have someone that is very dehydrated; the water is there but nobody to give to [them], and they die of dehydration. When people die, are their bodies removed right away? Yeah, sometimes even less than 30 minutes or 10 minutes the body is gone because they have maybe 10 patients waiting outside for someone to die inside to get a bed. So those waiting for a bed, they're happy. And for those inside it's just waiting: Who's next, who's next, who's next? When you were at your most depressed, what did you do to keep your spirits? One of the patients brought me a Bible. I was reading the Bible and I was talking very often with my family in Canada. I had a lot of people calling me: my colleagues, my nurses or my patients. And they were praying with me over the phone because there was no visitation at that time. That gave me a lot of hope. Over time, did caregivers help to ease the situation? Yeah, the health care [workers], they were very good, and they were very dedicated to the patients. I really congratulate them. The courage they were giving, the attention they were giving to the patients. I was even thinking they were pastors because they were just coming, and sometimes instead of giving you medication, they start preaching and talking about the Bible and maybe read a verse of the Bible. And then they give you the medication, and say, 'Okay God will help you.' When you have Ebola you can't be touched by anybody, people come to you wearing these big PPEs. Did you miss the human touch? When you become a patient, you want the doctor to touch you and to maybe check your hemoglobin. I remember I was just all the time asking, 'Dr. [Jerry] Brown, I think you need to check my hemoglobin.' He said, no, I think everything is fine. I said, 'No, you need to check my hemoglobin.' So you want someone to touch you. You miss the human touch. But at the same time, you understand they need to protect themselves. Because yeah, they have a PPE, but you can make a mistake. When they touch the patients they [can come ] in contact with the virus, and they can contaminate themselves when they're removing the PPE or even when the gloves are damaged. It was normal to see someone wearing PPE. But it was difficult because you cannot recognize the person treating you, you don't see the face. Everything is difficult to recognize. So they must become kind of nonhuman too. [Laughs] At some point, yes. The funny thing is when I was discharged I could not even recognize them. Did you think you were going to die? At some point, when I passed my second week, when my diarrhea stopped, my vomiting stopped, I was having hope I would survive. Because at that time, I started eating well, I started having my appetite back, and I started having my strength little by little. And the fear of dying started vanishing. You were given ZMapp, the experimental anti-Ebola drug. I was among the first recipient in Liberia. I was very lucky. Were you the only one to get ZMapp? No, there were three who received it, three healthcare workers. Do you think you would have survived without it? Maybe. Because at that time, I started to feel much better; my vomiting stopped. The diarrhea was not that much anymore; maybe I was start going to the bathroom maybe two or three times a day and before it was more than that. That's the time I received my ZMapp. After receiving the second dose I started feeling much better, much stronger. So I think it helped speed up the recovery. Your two colleagues who also were given ZMapp, did they survive? One died because of underlying conditions. But one was in a coma, and once she received the ZMapp, after the second dose she got off from her coma, and she started working, and she survived. What was it like being disconnected from the outside world? It's very difficult. You don't feel like [you're] living in a normal world anymore. The ETU is like a living war or hell. It's like you're living in hell. The only person you see is the nurse, and they even stay a distance from you when you talk, so no touch. So you feel like ... I don't know how to describe it ... maybe a ghost. Is there anything that you learned from being a patient that you keep in mind as you treat Ebola patients? I learned the suffering of Ebola. As a doctor, I'd never seen a disease like Ebola. What I experienced with Ebola I don't think there is any sickness that can equal Ebola symptoms — the way people feel in the body. I don't want these [Ebola patients] to go through what I went through. It's a very, very unbearable disease. Even after surviving, when you think about what you went through, it's not easy. I think that experience gave me the courage to do what I'm doing now [at the hospital]. Does it make you feel invincible having survived Ebola? No, it doesn't [make me] feel invincible, but it gave me just another dimension of thinking: Ebola, we can overcome it. If I did it, other people also can do it. Do you feel like it changed you? It changed my way of work. I need to be very cautious. Infection prevention is a key element, so taking care of the patient you have to protect yourself. Even though you are immune, you can also transmit to others. So I can bring the virus from one patient to another. So it changed my way of dealing with my work. Also, it changed my way to see this: we, as health care workers, we are victims, we are in the front line, but we also are the solution to this problem. If we having the fear of facing the virus, this virus will never be eradicated in Liberia. We are the warriors, so we need to fight this disease. Has it changed the way that you look at your own life? It helped me to see the world very different now. Nothing is [taken for] granted. Do people treat you differently knowing you're an Ebola survivor? The stigma is almost over. But when we just came from the ETU, the stigma was there. When people were coming to see me they'll stay at the door outside and just greet you there. So they don't even want to come inside the door, inside of your house, because they're still thinking you can give the virus to others. So even to go outside, it was very difficult. For people who know you and saw you, maybe at a gathering, maybe a church, people start taking a distance from you. So you have to live with it and deal with it. I've dealt with that in my way. It's normal to have fear of being close to me, but I think I'm the one who feels sorry for you because I survived Ebola, but you haven't contracted Ebola yet. And I feel sorry for you just in case — God forbid — you have the disease [and] you may not have the chance of survival. It's normal to have a fear, I understand you. But we don't contract Ebola this way [from survivors]. So we need to agree to accept those people who survived Ebola. They are free of the virus. Did it make you feel doubly victimized having been victimized already by Ebola? Yes. Because you are victimized being sick and now victimized by the community or the society. You must have felt lonely. Yeah, you feel lonely. You feel like you're rejected. How has your family dealt with this? Thank God my family was not here when I was sick. All of my family lives in Canada. My daughter was here in May and left in June. I was sick just a month after she left Liberia. Did you wish they were there? If I was sick they would be the ones to take care of me, and they could be exposed [to Ebola]. Maybe I could have a chance to survive, maybe one of them not. So I praise God for none of them being with me. Do you remember the day you were declared Ebola free? It was August 27 when my test result came, and they called me and said I was free of Ebola. What was that like? I could not believe it. I was very, very happy. I was praising the Lord. Did you celebrate? No. I prayed. There was no way to celebrate while you see a lot of people around you dying and sick. I was just praising the Lord and saying okay, 'Thank you, to make it through this.' In the meantime, even though you're happy, you see all the people lying, dying so it's no celebration. Are you treating Ebola patients now? How many Ebola patients do you have at the hospital? This [hospital] is not an ETU; we don't treat them here. But we can receive some suspected cases that we transfer to ETUs [elsewhere in Monrovia]. I think, so far, we've received like six suspected cases since we opened the hospital two weeks now, which we transferred to the ETU. You said when you went to the ETU you had 15 colleagues who were also infected. What happened to them? Six survived, and we lost nine. Good friends? Yeah, we were co-workers. They really work here as a family, everybody, we all love each other here. To lose even one person is very, very sad. And those nine people died I think in three days. Were you with them at the ETU? Were you able to give them any comfort? We were hopeless because we were all very weak. I remember one day when I was able to walk a little bit inside the ETU, and I went there and the two sisters were there with us. I couldn't even recognize one of the brothers who was here, Brother George. And the sister said doctor, that's Brother George. And he was very weak. He had his bottle of mineral water; he could not even take it. I just look at him and said, 'Brother.' He looked at me, and he just opened his eye, and it was finished. So very sad. The president of Liberia had said she wants zero new cases by Christmas. I don't think it is realistic. Maybe we hope by January or February or in three months maybe we can, because we are containing the outbreak in Liberia. But it's not over yet. Only one case can make things again coming back. So we have to be very prudent. It's not time for celebration yet. What would you say to people who are in isolation wards and cut off from the rest of the world if you could say something to them, being a survivor? What I can tell them is even though they are isolated it's not because the people don't love them. The people will still be loved by their family, by their loved ones. They need to keep hope. Ebola is a deadly virus, but there's a lot of people who survived. They just have to keep hope, take their medication, drink a lot of water to fight the dehydration, because one of the causes of death is dehydration. And they need to remember people outside are praying for them, loving them, and want them back.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,
2888699,hepatitis,NIC,10/21/2014 23:17,0,"The Local System of Integral Health Care (Silais) department of Matagalpa, in northern Nicaragua, today expressed concern about the outbreak of hepatitis registered on Monday at a school in that region. Government spokeswoman Nicaragua, Rosario Murillo, said Tuesday that are catering to the eight people in the health center Silais, where they came with affectations of hepatitis. He added that seeks to guarantee health coverage to prevent the outbreak of hepatitis registered at school spread. 'We will take all measures to prevent the outbreak (hepatitis), spread', also explained the First Lady of Nicaragua. Last July, the Nicaraguan government warned of the presence of five people affected with hepatitis 'A', according to the records of the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Department of Carazo (southwest). The outbreak was detected last July in children three to nine years in the province of Carazo. At that time, the Silais province of Carazo recommended that people go to the health center if they experience vomiting, diarrhea and loss of appetite, symptoms of hepatitis 'A'. Hepatitis 'A' is a viral disease transmitted by fecal-oral route and your symptoms are mild in most cases, with an incubation period of 15-60 days.",NA,es,0,,,,,,,

The pair, who have not been named, were being kept in isolation after showing flu-like symptoms following a trip to Mexico where the virus has now killed more than 100. They arrived back in Scotland last Tuesday and doctors have been frantically tracing everyone they have come into contact with since then in case of further infection. Conclusive results on the two holidaymakers' conditions are due later today but so far they are not 'particularly unwell', Scotland's Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said. 'We are doing everything we can at this stage to ensure that the chance of any infection, should it prove to be the case, is minimised,' she added. An emergency summit has already been called to discuss how to tackle the deadly disease and Health Secretary Alan Johnson says Britain is on 'constant alert'. Governments worldwide are now battling to contain public panic after the virus raged across borders over the weekend. In Mexico, it has claimed 103 lives with another 1,614 believed to be infected. Cases have also been confirmed in the U.S and Canada. There are suspected cases in France, Spain, Brazil, Israel and New Zealand. 'Given the way in which this has spread across America, with cases now in Mexico, inside of the United States and in Canada, I think it would be wises to expect cases,' he said. Professor Nigel Dimmock, a virologist from Warwick University, added: 'Swine flu could already have reached the UK. There really is cause to worry. If it's a new virus no one will have any immunity. It will not be possible to keep it out.' swine flu A British Airways worker taken to hospital with flu-like symptoms after returning from Mexico City was yesterday found not to be suffering from the virus. And this morning another Briton, Chris Clarke from Northamptonshire, was also told his tests were negative. 'Clearly that is very good news,' he said. Leading officials from the Department of Health, Home Office and Foreign Office held crisis meetings under the emergency Cobra system on Sunday. The European Union is also looking to hold an urgent meeting of health ministers to discuss the outbreak. EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said: 'We are following the situation very closely, together with the member states.' Mexico City went into virtual lockdown yesterday. Mass was said in shuttered cathedrals and football teams played to empty stadiums Most people stayed at home, with the few who did venture onto the streets wearing surgical masks to avoid infection. One television variety show resorted to using cardboard cutouts to fill the seats in the audience. And for the first time in 300 years, the Cathedral in the main plaza pulled an icon of the Lord of Health from storage, and worshippers placed it on the principal altar. Today, there were fears cases could multiply as people returned to work. Employers were ordered to isolate anyone showing suspicious symptoms as a precaution. In the U.S., where 20 cases have been confirmed, officials declared a public health emergency and the public were advised to buy painters' masks to protect themselves. Among those infected are a group of eight schoolchildren from New York who recently returned from a trip to Mexico. Six from the Canadian province of Nova Scotia have also had swine flu confirmed. In New Zealand, ten pupils from an Auckland school party that had returned from Mexico were being treated for flu symptoms in what authorites said was a likely case. Meanwhile in northern France, two people returning from Mexico were being tested. Three cases in Spain and another one in Israel were also being investigated. Russia has curbed meat exports from Mexico and some U.S. states - even though experts say there is no chance of getting the disease from pork. There are concerns that an outbreak in Britain could put untold pressure on the NHS, which faces criticism for failing to be prepared for a crisis. One expert said it had the power to kill 1.2million in the UK alone. British holidaymakers wearing face masks were held up for almost an hour of tests when they touched down at Heathrow Airport yesterday on a flight from Mexico. But others flying in to Manchester this morning said they had not been put through any checks either leaving Mexico or on arrival in the UK. Elizabeth Lacey, 24, said: 'There were no checks flying out. We were a bit concerned about that. There were no checks, we came through and no one asked anything.' Marie Thompson, from Gateshead, added: 'It was a bit scary, really. The airport in Cancun was full of people wearing masks. If you think back to the Sars episode in China, it was like that.' Mahood A Cabinet Office spokesman confirmed a Cobra meeting was held on Sunday. Cobra meetings - named for the 'Cabinet Office Briefing Room A' where the meetings are generally held - are meetings held in response to national crisis, and were recently held after the London bombings and September 11. Professor Dimmock said: 'We may have to prepare ourselves for a new pandemic virus - the fourth in the last 100 years. 'This has the potential to be bigger than Spanish influenza. We will know in the next few days exactly how nasty this is going to be. 'Viruses like these are very efficient at swapping genetic information, so I would not be at all surprised if it did spread very quickly and get as far as Britain. We have to hope for the best and plan for the worst.' Mr Johnson promised that all travellers returning from Mexico with flu-like symptoms would be seen very quickly. The Health Secretary said there were large stockpiles of the anti-viral drug Tamiflu, which has proved to be effective against the new strain in Mexico. 'We have got a whole range of measures in place. We have a stockpile of the drugs and we have an agreement with a manufacturer so as soon as the scientists can find a vaccine, they can produce it.' He added: 'If you have flu-like symptoms, don't go to your GP but stay at home and call NHS Direct. The whole point about these kinds of epidemics is you don't want to spread them - and you spread them by going out and mixing with other people.' Mr Johnson said it would be 'futile' to impose a travel ban between the UK and Mexico. Experts say the swine flu is worse than the previous bird flu outbreaks, which have killed more than 250 people in 15 countries, because it appears to pass from human to human. Bird flu only ever passed from a bird to a human - limiting its potential to kill. The new strain is a mixture of various swine, human and bird viruses, making it even more potent to the human body which is used to dealing only with human strains of flu. Dr Alan Hay, director of the World Influenza centre in London, said: 'It looks pretty ominous, one has to say. It's difficult to look on the bright side at the moment.' Dr Maureen Baker, in charge of pandemic flu planning for the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: 'It would be extremely unrealistic to think there could be a flu pandemic and we wouldn't get it here in Britain.' Professor Hugh Pennington, professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University, warned that existing vaccines would be no use against swine flu, and that it would take months to develop an effective one. He said: 'Any flu virus of this type can have the potential to be very nasty. That's the big worry. You have combinations of viruses that can spread round very easily, and can also affect young people - just like the outbreak in 1918.' But Professor John Oxford, virologist at Barts hospital in London, was more hopeful the outbreak could be contained in the UK. 'I suspect this flu could come over to Britain,' he said. 'It is on the runway and ready to take off. But the whole country is extremely well organised, and I suspect any case will be picked up very quickly. 'It could arrive and cause small localised outbreaks in the spring and summer. It may return in the winter - but in the meantime we will have hopefully developed a vaccine.' Swine Flu Q&A Hoping for the best in eerie Mexico City With its teeming population of 21million, it is usually one of the world's busiest places but Mexico City was yesterday reduced to an eerie silence. Events from church services to sports fixtures were called off to prevent crowds from spreading the new flu strain. Health officials advised everyone to stay at home where possible. About a dozen federal police in blue surgical masks stood in front of Mexico City's Metropolitan Cathedral, which was nearly empty. Roman Catholic officials were planning to hold Mass last night inside an empty Basilica of the Virgin of Guadeloupe for radio broadcast. Johana Chavez, 22, said she showed up for her confirmation only to find a sign advising that all Masses, baptisms and confirmations were cancelled until further notice. ",NA,NA,0,,,,,,,
2953797,ebola,LBR,11/13/2014 0:00,0,"GA/11854 Sixty-ninth session, Meeting on Ebola (AM) General Assembly Meetings Coverage **More than 5,000 Confirmed Fatalities, Actual Death Toll Likely Much Higher** The global fight against the Ebola virus so far had aborted a worst-case scenario of runaway increases in infections, but the disease was far from contained, delegates in the General Assembly heard today during an information briefing on the crisis. “Ebola is a fearsome enemy and we will not win the battle by chasing it,” said Anthony Banbury, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER), stressing the urgent need to “get ahead of it”. He began his briefing by acknowledging the Secretary-General’s effort to implement Assembly resolution 69/1 that established UNMEER and a rapid passage by the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) of a temporary financing arrangement, known as a commitment authority, to make the Mission operational. He noted that the crisis had just exceeded a grim milestone of 5,000 confirmed deaths, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, with the real number likely to be much higher. Communities previously untouched were now seeing Ebola spread rapidly. Devastation went far beyond the human toll, with 3,300 children estimated to have become Ebola orphans, food prices rising, schools closed and traders afraid of coming to markets. In Nigeria, one case resulted in 899 contacts, requiring 54 teams and 18,000 visits. He expressed concern that many countries in the region did not have the health infrastructure to effectively and rapidly respond to an outbreak. The good news was that the worst-case scenario of sustained exponential increases in victims did not materialize and many communities were seeing significant decreases in the infection rate, including hard-hit Monrovia, Liberia. One main reason for the improvement was local community engagement with people changing their behaviours. Another factor was strong national responses supported by international assistance. Mr. Banbury continued to outline elements for a successful response, including national leadership, crisis management structure and national plans. It was necessary to establish treatment facilities, trace contacts, ensure safe and dignified burials and mobilize society. Those interventions must be supported by five enabling activities – logistics, training, payment of workers, information management and human resource mobilization. Headquartered in Ghana and operational in the three most affected countries, UNMEER had been busy deploying capabilities, with 142 personnel already in place and eight logistics centres established, Mr. Banbury said. Assessing the Mission’s performance, he said the United Nations had responded to the unique challenges of Ebola in an unprecedented, innovative way, across bureaucratic barriers, to deliver a robust, tailored crisis response capability in record time. Going forward, the Mission needed people especially in local districts, more but smaller Ebola treatment units, community care centres, partners on the ground to train staff and manage facilities and money to pay for activities. David Nabarro, the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Ebola, recalled that last month he had described the disease as the most extraordinary public health challenge the world could face. Actions by communities and affected countries, local and national Governments had been exemplary, and there was good evidence that people were changing the way they lived and behaved to reduce the likelihood of experiencing the disease. That people-based response was at the heart of positive changes that had been seen. Globally, he continued, a coalition had been developing and functioning as a joined-up community. The United Nations system was coming together with an unprecedented level of coordination. Like a shoal of fish moving suddenly, adjustments had to be made to what was being done, in light of new challenges emerging. Susana Malcorra, Chef de Cabinet of the Secretary-General, said that while intervention was taking place in the short-term, there was a need to start thinking about longer-term issues. Sam Kutesa, President of the General Assembly, said the international community must remain seized and continue to provide the much-needed support for combatting the disease, which was far from contained. “Even as we sit today, many people in the affected countries are losing the battle against Ebola,” he said. Tolbert Nyenswah, Chair of the Incidence Management System for Ebola Response of Liberia, said that the Government there was fighting against Ebola in three phases. The first was to stop the increase in infection rates and reverse the trend. It started to see empty beds at health facilities. That goal had been already achieved. By the end of September, the increase stopped and new infections started to decrease. Liberia had entered the second phase, the most critical one. Although the infection rate was decreasing, it was now levelling off. The final phase would be to continue surveillance and stop human-to-human transmissions, which would require holistic regional responses. Guinea’s representative said some progress had been made and logistic strengthening was happening. Ill people were being treated and there was better management of the bodies of the victims. But the international community could not “rest on its laurels” and additional efforts were necessary. The epidemic had affected health services, agricultural production and transportation by air and sea. Tourism had virtually halted. Urban employment was destroyed. The contributions were below those that were necessary, he said, urging that travel restrictions not be imposed and borders not be closed. Sierra Leone’s representative said the news from his country remained grim. The daily death toll remained high, and health workers were striking because they were not being paid. Funds should go to worthwhile projects as soon as possible. In the outlying areas, the lack of simple tools, such as radios, meant burials kept happening in an unsafe way. Efforts to help the country’s health system had to be invigorated and staffing levels replenished as health workers died. The test of success would be when hospital beds were empty and when the most isolated villages had heard the news and individuals changed their behaviour. Speed was a critical factor in fighting the epidemic and it was not helpful if resources remained in warehouses and did not get to the doctors and other health care workers. In the ensuing interactive dialogue, Brazil’s representative noted that the three most-affected countries were in post-conflict stages. The presence of the international community had helped ensure that peacebuilding efforts there had not suffered during the epidemic. But those nations bordered several countries in conflict: Mali, Cote d’Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau. The disease had to be prevented from spread into those conflict-ridden areas, he stressed, urging UNMEER to redouble its efforts to ensure that did not happen. The United States’ delegate stressed the importance of private-sector engagement, urging companies already doing business in the region to stay and United States firms to invest in the region. Those actors would help the region’s long-term economic and social recovery, she said. Benin’s representative emphasized the importance of focusing efforts on isolating the disease, not the countries. Even his country, far from the sources of the disease, was feeling the economic consequences. Many delegations expressed their solidarity with the affected countries and outlined their unique contributions to the global fight against Ebola, with a representative of the European Union delegation saying that its Member States had mobilized more than $1.25 billion to fight the epidemic. The Union had launched an initiative to boost research on Ebola by providing almost $350 million to accelerate the creation and production of a vaccine and potentially life-saving drugs. Cuba, its delegate said, had sent specialized doctors to the area and its health-care workers were working throughout Africa. The representatives of China and Japan were also among the speakers who described how their countries were helping contain the epidemic through financial, in-kind and personnel contributions. Mauritania’s delegate, speaking on behalf of the African Group, welcomed the efforts of the World Bank, the African Development Bank and other institutions working to collect financial resources. Also speaking today were the delegates of the United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Egypt, India, France, Australia and Turkey, as well as the representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The General Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Friday, 14 November, to discuss its agenda item on integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields.

The WHO said real numbers should be much higher than reported: by a factor of 1.5 times in Guinea, Sierra Leone of 2 and 2.5 Liberia, with the next death rate of 70% all cases. That would suggest a total of deaths of almost 15,000. Liberia was the worst hit, with 4,665 reported cases and 2,705 deaths, followed by Sierra Leone with 3,706 cases and 1,259 deaths. Guinea, where the outbreak began, recorded 1,540 cases and 904 deaths. Last Friday [17 / Oct / 2014], WHO put the total 745 cases with less. Last week, the transmission of the disease has intensified in the cities of Monrovia and Freetown, while in the capital of Guinea, Conakry, were confirmed 18 cases, the second highest weekly figure since the beginning of the outbreak. Although Ebola has been contained in Nigeria and Senegal, the disease is spreading in the direction of Ivory Coast both Liberia and by Guinea, including the district Kankan, Guinea, one of the main routes to Mali. Kankan saw its first case last week. However, WHO said the Liberian district of Lofa recorded the third consecutive week of decline in numbers of cases, with reports indicating that the change was a result of control measures. Among the thousands of cases there are 443 workers in the health sector, with 244 of them died. The WHO said it is conducting extensive analyzes to determine why the number of victims in the sector is so high.

184925,influenza,USA,5/1/2009 12:41,NA,"Blaming ‘Media Hype’ for Swine Flu Fears By ROBERT MACKEY Warnings by public health officials this week that the spread of a new strain of H1N1 swine flu meant that a global pandemic was “imminent” were followed by the clarification that the word pandemic will be used “even if the new virus turns out to cause mainly mild symptoms.” The situation presented the world’s news media with a conundrum: How loudly should a responsible person shout (or whisper) “Possible Fire!” in a crowded theater? The question has been easy to answer for broadcasters, Web sites and newspapers that see the world in tabloid terms. In London, the free commuter newspaper Metro started its coverage on Sunday with the headline “Swine flu ‘could kill up to 120m’,” over a picture of Mexican police with masks and machine guns. Likewise, no one has been shocked that many anchors on 24-hour-a-day cable news channels, which have a lot of time to fill, have spent a good deal of it hyperventilating. These days, that is to be expected — after all, Jon Stewart makes a very good living pointing out night after night that those channels tend to overreact at some stage to almost every crisis they report. That’s what they do. Then you have public health officials around the world who are trying to stress that people should be prepared for an emergency, even if one never materializes. To continue the metaphor, they are just whispering loudly, “Make sure the theater has fire extinguishers!” AudioMonica Davey of The Times on swine flu fears (mp3) As Monica Davey reports in today’s New York Times, a result of all this is that many non-experts in influenza have found this week’s media coverage of the H1N1 swine flu virus confusing, if not infuriating. Ms. Davey found that many Americans were engaged in the balancing act of trying to stay informed about the dangers without getting carried away by fear — and as they did, some people she spoke to “complained bitterly about the news media’s ‘over-hyping’ of the matter.” Several readers of The Lede have posted comments echoing that sentiment. Now that news cycles have sped up the rate at which information spreads, it also seems to have sped up the rate at which people become overloaded with information — and then blame the news media for not doing a better job of communicating clearly the exact risks posed by threats like potential flu pandemics or brewing hurricanes. On Thursday, for instance, a reader named Carl N. wrote a comment on this blog: I don’t get it. Why are we so worried? Every winter influenza takes tens of thousands of lives! Does the media realize this? Why are they acting like every single (even nonfatal) case means we are about to hit by the bubonic plague? The same day, another reader, using the screen name CB, asked: Why is this flu getting so much attention? Other than the severe pocket in Mexico, it doesn’t seem to be more deadly than the “regular” flu. And even the Mexican statistics are still rolling in, so can we be sure it’s even that bad there? Does this flu’s rate of transmission somehow correlate with an ability to mutate into something worse? Are the C.D.C. and W.H.O. really just practicing for something worse? The amount of panic weighed against the actual numbers is very off kilter. Then on Thursday in Texas, when Fort Worth closed every school in the city and sent 80,000 students home to prevent the spread of infection, Gov. Rick Perry said that the state’s problems were being exacerbated by “a substantial amount of media hype.” So, with the blame-the-media reaction in full flow, some parts of the media sprang into action by trying to jump on the anti-media bandwagon. Ben Goldacre, a British doctor who writes — in columns, blog and books — about the perils of what he calls “Bad Science,” pointed out in an article for The Guardian on Thursday that at least some media outlets were trying to get in on the backlash against the media’s coverage of the swine flu outbreak. Dr. Goldacre began by defending the media’s coverage of what still could be the very early stages of a serious outbreak: “Everyone is just saying: we don’t know, it could be bad, and the newspapers are reporting that. Sure, there’s a bit of vaudeville in the headlines, but they’re not saying things that are wrong.” Then he detailed the calls he received from various media outlets that, incorrectly, expected him to appear on their programs to say that the media was making too much of the threat posed by swine flu: By Tuesday, pundit-seekers from the media were suddenly contacting me, a massive nobody, to say that swine flu is all nonsense and hype, like some kind of blind, automated naysaying device. “Will you come and talk about the media overhyping swine flu?” asked Case Notes on Radio 4. No. “We need someone to say it’s all been overhyped,” said BBC Wales. [...] In the time that I have been writing this piece – no embellishment – I’ve had similar calls off This Week at the BBC (”Is the coverage misleading?”), Al-Jazeera English (”We wanted to talk to someone on the other side, you know, challenging the fear factor”), the Richard Bacon Show on Five Live (”Is it another media scare like Sars and bird flu?”) and many more. I’m not showing off. I know I’m a D-list public intellectual, but I just think it’s interesting: because not only have the public lost all faith in the media; not only do so many people assume, now, that they are being misled; but more than that, the media themselves have lost all confidence in their own ability to give us the facts. In his article, and in a subsequent audio interview with The Guardian, Dr. Goldacre argues that the problem is that besides now not trusting the media — which has perhaps cried wolf one, or 7,000 times too often in recent years — the public in general is “poorly equipped to think around issues involving risk.” While, as he says “infectious diseases epidemiology is a tricky business: the error margins on the models are wide, and it’s extremely hard to make clear predictions,” the demand from many media consumers seems to be: ‘Tell us exactly what is going to happen and how bad it will be.’ In response to the suggestion that current reporting on the risk of a dangerous swine flu pandemic might later seem to be as unnecessary as earlier reporting on the grave risk of pandemic outbreaks of SARS or bird flu, Dr. Goldacre says, simply: “They were risks, risks that didn’t materialise, but they were still risks. That’s what a risk is. I’ve never been hit by a car, but it’s not idiotic to think about it.” So what is the answer for confused media consumers in an era of 24/7 television and Internet coverage? Possibly it is just this: first, people may need to abandon their hope that the many, many voices that make up the world’s media today will suddenly start singing as a chorus, and figure out which of those many voices seem to regularly deliver credible information. Then, as Dr. Goldacre advises, we may all have to accept that disease forecasting — like weather forecasting — is more of a guide to what might happen that a certain prediction of what will happen. The analogy that might be most useful in thinking about the “boy who cried wolf” problem is what happened before Hurricane Katrina: Many people simply refused to believe, after years of warnings about hurricanes that turned out to be less than apocalyptic, that there was any need to evacuate the city. That’s not to say that every disease outbreak will turn into a dangerous pandemic, any more than every storm will turn into a Katrina-sized emergency — but keeping an eye on the weather forecast is still a good idea.",NA,NA,0,,,,,,,

If you've ever wondered if that's true, you need only consider just how quickly President Obama changed 'swine flu' to the obscure, overly scientific, and far more syllable-rich name H1N1, as per the request of the pork lobby. The pork industry has also put the kibosh on stories that the first human and pig outbreaks, respectively, of the swine flu epidemic were linked to an American-owned pig feedlot in Mexico and one in North Carolina. Well, now that argument has a strange but potentially powerful spokesperson: Jonathan Safran Foer, author of Everything Is Illuminated , Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close , and recently Eating Animals , a nonfiction book that makes the case against that activity.

(No humans were infected.) No one has been able to prove that link conclusively, but scientists have made a reasonable case . Scientists and health policy experts agree that swine flu was likely incubated at a factory hog farm, where close quarters and high turnover facilitate widespread illness. In other words, the vector of this particular virus notwithstanding, feedlots are a risk factor that deserve to be examined.

2993101,ebola,GIN,11/26/2014 0:00,0,"IFRC supports National Societies with international emergency appeals to combat Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal. The appeals employ a 5 pillar approach spelled out in an Ebola regional framework, comprising: (1) Beneficiary Communication and Social Mobilization; (2) Contact Tracing and Surveillance; (3) Psychosocial Support; (4) Case Management; and (5) Safe and Dignified Burials (SDB) and Disinfection. In addition, a regional appeal was launched to accommodate multi-country support needs. IFRC also continues to support smaller preparedness and response operations financed under its Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) in Mali, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Togo, Benin, Central African Republic, Chad, Gambia, Kenya and Guinea Bissau and now Ethiopia, making a total of 16 countries that have emergency operations relating to this outbreak. In Guinea, the trend of the epidemic is increasing; the number of cases at this point in November is greater than the number of cases seen for the same period of October. This past week has seen an increase in cases among medical professionals working outside of the health response structure. The infections were caused by a lack of full adherence to protective measures. Of all community burials in Guinea, it is estimated that only 83% are secure because of community resistance and families are still refusing to safely bury their loved ones. Red Cross SDB teams are traveling to the communities where deaths are being reported, but families continue to refuse assistance. According to WHO, Ebola transmission remains widespread and intense in Sierra Leone, except in the south east. 709 new cases were reported in the week, with Freetown, the capital, remaining the worst affected area. The districts of Bo, Bombali, Koinadugu, Kono, Moyamba, Port Loko, Tonkolili and Western Area have reported high numbers of cases recently. The decrease in the number of cases in the south east where the outbreak began indicates that the response efforts by Red Cross and other partners have been effective. The Red Cross is scaling up the number of burial teams to 49 through the training of new SDB volunteers in workshops in the next two weeks. Further scaling up and coordination in social mobilization and contact tracing is planned. The health programme is also looking to recruit a psychosocial support delegate to assist in this vital activity. On Monday, another person tested positive for the Ebola virus in Mali, bringing the total number of cases in the country to eight. Five deaths have been recorded so far. Mali Red Cross is acting with support from 7 Partner National Societies (French, Danish, Belgium, Suisse, Luxembourg, Spanish, and Canadian Red Cross). ICRC and IFRC are also working with the National Society. 74 volunteers have been involved in contact tracing. So far, 288 contacts have been traced, and the most recent new cases have been among those traced. The National Society has provided hand-washing facilities in schools and mosques in the six communes of Bamako. The NS has inadequate capacity in logistics. There are difficulties in carrying out field activities, as there are only 2 vehicles. At present, there is no official government request for an international emergency appeal. However, Mali RC and partners are requesting for support on social mobilisation, contact tracing and SDB.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

World Bulletin / News Desk Ghanaian President John DramaniMahama declined to shake hands with Guinean ministers – apparently over fears of Ebola – during a recent visit to the small West African nation. Mahama, who heads the rotating chairmanship of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), arrived in Guinean capital Conakry on Monday. Upon his arrival, he shook hands with Guinean President Alpha Conde and the latter's diplomatic staff at the airport, but declined to shake hands with cabinet ministers. Later, he inspected measures being adopted by the Guinean government aimed at fighting Ebola before returning home. In recent months, Ebola – a contagious disease for which there is no known treatment or cure – has claimed more than 2,400 lives in West Africa, according to the World Health Organization.

Andriukatis claimed that only cooperation and common action at community, county and country levels can help stamp the virus from countries hit by the virus as soon as possible and restore hope and confidence in the people once again. The EU envoy made the statement at a joint press conference at the Foreign Ministry in Monrovia on Friday. He lauded the government and people of Liberia for the level of work they have done in tackling the virus shown by a decline in the number of new cases in the country. Andriukatis who is heading a 15-member EU team touring the Ebola hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, cautioned the government to get more involved in community based approach and to improve the country’s public healthcare delivery system in order to eradicate the virus.

2945669,ebola,USA,11/11/2014 8:55,6,"Why Is This Important? Because it illustrates the robustness of the U.S. medical system against a highly deadly but moderately contagious threat such as Ebola. Long Story Short Forty-three days after Ebola was first diagnosed in the United States, the country now appears to be completely free of the virus. Long Story The New York Times has reported that Craig Spencer, the 33-year-old doctor who became the first person in New York to test positive for Ebola, is free of the virus and is set to be released from Bellevue Hospital Center today (Tuesday). It means the United States is now free from all known cases of the disease, although the World Health Organisation doesn't officially declare a country cleared of Ebola until it has had no new cases for six weeks. On the face of it, the news is not especially surprising. Experts predicted that the United States health system would easily cope with the threat of a highly deadly but moderately contagious virus such as Ebola. But it stands in stark release to the flimsy panic that followed Spencer’s initial diagnosis. Spencer was criticised on social media for travelling about New York in the days before his diagnosis, and there were baseless initial reports that the 33-year-old had lied about his movements. Meanwhile, New York, New Jersey and several other states tried to introduce mandatory twenty-one day quarantines — a move criticised by the federal government and slammed by Kaci Hickox, a returning nurse affected by the policy. Vox reports that the United States government has learned from this Ebola outbreak that patients treated in a modern healthcare system have much higher rates of survival, with only one of the nine treated in the country having died. The US patients also didn’t spread the disease nearly as readily. But while the panic may have subsided in the United States, Ebola continues to rage on in Africa. The virus has killed more than 4,800 people this year, with the highest number of deaths occurring in September and October. The World Health Organisation released a situation report on November 7 stating that: “Case incidence is declining in some districts in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, while steep rises persist in other districts.” It’s a sharp reminder that Ebola hasn’t been beaten, and it will require the work of people such as Craig Spencer and Kaci Hickox — dedicated medical staff willing to put themselves in danger to help others — to successfully slay this latest outbreak, the largest in history.

'When we waste time and disorganize this struggle, the disease will XXXXXX Four People Died in Cholera Riot Maputo &mdash; Four people lost their lives when the Mozambican police opened fire on a mob destroying a cholera treatment centre in the northern province of Cabo Delgado earlier this month, according to a report in the Beira daily paper 'Diario de Mozambique'. The incident took place on 11 November when a crowd attacked a treatment centre in the village of Muadja, in Ancuabe district. They had been convinced by malicious rumours circulating in Mozambique that the health workers trying to stamp out cholera are actually spreading the disease. According to the Ancuabe district police commander, Crisanto Saide, cited by the paper, in the clash at Muaja some of the rioters seized a gun from a police officer. The police then opened fire to disperse the crowd, and six of the rioters were shot dead. The police have detained six people, accused of leading the attack on the centre. The Cabo Delgado provincial governor, Eliseu Machava, visited Ancuabe last week, and urged local people 'don't complicate the job of the health workers'. 'Cholera is not brought here by health professionals', said Machava. 'On the contrary, they are fighting to stop the spread of the diseases that affect us, and we have to collaborate'. 'When we waste time and disorganize this struggle, the disease will not go away, and thus many people will die', he warned. The situation in Muaja is now reported to be calm.

3074178,ebola,USA,1/6/2015 7:36,0,"As the director for the Center for Disaster Medical Preparedness at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and an emergency physician, Dr. Kristi Koenig has experience in emergency medicine and reacting quickly in a public health emergency. “Although (UCI’s) resources are stretched, I think we are prepared [for a biological outbreak like Ebola or an attack, like anthrax,]” Koenig said in a recent interview with BioPrepWatch.com. In a public health emergency, response comes in multiple stages. First, there’s the need for a comprehensive emergency management plan; mitigation of potential risks; preparation; and when the public health threat occurs, there’s the response and recovery. There are several components that would help immensely in improving responses to public health and emergency response situations, Koenig said. They include increasing the understanding of different areas of emergency response, establishment of clear preparation and response protocols, and training on how to make difficult decisions in public health emergencies such as an outbreak of Ebola. “It’s important to remember that these events are global in nature,” Koenig said. “The big threats are emerging infectious diseases and these diseases are changing.” Koenig is also a member of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Ebola Expert Panel, and a guest editor of the Disaster Medical and Public Health Preparedness Journal’s Ebola issue. To manage the unknowns, Koenig said it’s important to define strict incident management protocols and coordination efforts. It is also important to create better understanding between policymakers and those responding to public health threats. “The people on the front lines don’t understand how policymaking works, and the policymakers don’t understand what is happening on the ground,” Koenig said. “We also need training for decision-makers, to make sure that those people are comfortable making these decisions.” Koenig said there are things that the public health and medical communities can do to improve their response, though. The medical community could use more education about public health situations, where it is important to look at a population and how things are occurring, instead of one patient at a time; the government could provide more education and training opportunities for the public health and medical communities, as well as more funding for training, Koenig said. “People are so busy with the day-to-day that their time isn’t allocated to allow for preparation training,” Koenig said.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

Speaking at the National Academy of Sciences, Obama said he is receiving regular updates on the situation and used the outbreak as a touchstone for why more investment is needed in the scientific and medical community. 'We are closely monitoring the emerging cases of swine flu in the United States,' Obama said. 'This is obviously a cause for concern and requires a heightened state of alert. But it is not a cause for alarm.' He added that the declaration of a 'public health emergency' Sunday is merely a precautionary tool in order to better allocate resources and be at the ready should a more severe outbreak occur. 'But one thing is clear - our capacity to deal with a public health challenge of this sort rests heavily on the work of our scientific and medical community,' he said. 'And this is one more example of why we cannot allow our nation to fall behind.' Obama described the irony of having an advanced medical system that 'holds the promise of unlocking new cures and treatments' with a health care system that could potentially bankrupt families and businesses. The president argued that although the nation is facing extreme financial difficulties, continued investment in science is 'more essential for our prosperity, our security, our health, our environment, and our quality of life than it has ever been.' 'And if there was ever a day that reminded us of our shared stake in science and research, it's today,' he added, referencing the swine flu outbreak. Obama pledged that his administration is 'providing the largest single boost to investment in basic research in American history,' following decades of declining investment. The proposed budget makes the research and experimentation tax credit permanent, allowing companies to afford the costs associated with developing new technologies and products.

3007383,chikungunya,FRA,12/2/2014 22:24,9,"Chikungunya, a debilitating mosquito-borne viral disease, has taken hold in French Polynesia, spreading rapidly and threatening neighbouring Pacific nations, regional health authorities said today. The disease, typically found in low levels in Africa and Asia, this year has infected almost a million people in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the World Health Organization. French Polynesia, with a population of more than 268,000, said four people had died and more than 18,000 people had sought treatment for the disease since October, the first outbreak in the archipelago. 'We think that about half of the population will be affected in this cycle,' said public health surveillance head Henri-Pierre Mallet, adding that the start of the rainy season would help the disease spread. Samoa has reported more than 2,500 cases since July, while American Samoa and Tokelau had also suffered outbreaks, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), based in New Caledonia, said. 'We are only half way through the chikungunya wave,' said Dr Adam Roth, an epidemiologist at the SPC. 'And there is certainly a big risk of infection for the (14) countries which have not had it yet,' he said. SPC is a regional organisation that helps the development of 22 countries. Chikungunya is spread by two mosquito species and can cause severe symptoms including fever, headache and joint pain. There is neither treatment nor vaccine. Among mosquito-borne diseases, chikungunya has the longest period of illness with some people developing long-term debilitating joint pain that can keeping them away from work for months. 'It's not only a big burden for healthcare systems but also for the economy,' Roth said. French Polynesia's $5 billion economy was hit by the global financial crisis which caused a severe drop in tourism, the nation's lifeblood. ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

State education officials said the school appears to be the first in New York to close this season because of the flu. Two students have tested positive for H1N1, or swine flu, Kuch said. There were about 147 students absent Wednesday out of a student population of 413, Kuch said. There are normally about 15 to 20 out sick. Kuch said matters were made worse when about 10 members of the teaching staff _ or one-fifth _ were out sick Wednesday. With concerns that teachers weren't able to introduce material and there wouldn't be adequate staffing, Kuch said the decision was made to close. The parent-teacher conference day scheduled for Friday will go ahead as planned, but if either party can't attend, it will be rescheduled, he said. Cynthia Moore, Otsego County public health emergency preparedness coordinator, said there were no other schools in the county that have the same level of illnesses as Worcester. The county no longer is involved with testing for H1N1, she said. The virus is treated the same as a seasonal flu, so it is important for students or teachers with flu-like symptoms to stay home, she said. Preventative steps include vaccination. Hygienic techniques such as washing hands often with soap and water, especially after coughing and sneezing, and avoiding touching one's eyes, nose and mouth should also be practiced, Moore said.

3061140,ebola,NGA,12/29/2014 16:37,0,"Ebola-hit Guinea to reopen schools on Monday CONAKRY, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Guinean government Wednesday announced schools across the Ebola-hit country will reopen on Monday after a three month delay as it continues to report low new cases. The education ministry said the decision was made after consultations with stakeholders including international health partners. Sanitary kits and hygienic protection equipment have already been distributed in various provinces to protect students and teachers against Ebola virus. In an official statement, the national education ministry urged all stakeholders to take all necessary measures to ensure learning resumes in schools and universities. The ministry further urged teachers and lecturers to quickly resume teaching in order to compensate for the time lost from October 2014 when classes were officially meant to start in Guinea. According to the World Heath Organization, Guinea, one of the worst-hit countries in West Africa, reported 42 confirmed cases in the seven days to Jan. 11, indicating that case incidence declined for the second week in a row to the lowest level nationally since the week ending Aug. 17, 2014.",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

The firm rose 0.88 percent to 3,422.5 yen by the break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after jumping more than four percent in the first few minutes of trade. The broader market was down 0.72 percent. Fujifilm said late Monday it would increase its stock of Avigan, which has been given to several patients who were evacuated from Ebola-hit west Africa to Europe. Fujifilm said it has enough Avigan tablets -- approved as an influenza drug in Japan -- to treat 20,000 people and enough of its active ingredient for 300,000 treatments. The company did not say by how much it would increase its finished stock of the drug. There is no licensed treatment for the Ebola virus, which has killed thousands in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, while cases have also been reported in the United States and Spain. The World Health Organization gave the green light in August for experimental treatments to be used in the outbreak, but there are limited stocks available. Some research papers report that Avigan has been effective in animal testing with mice, the company said. The governments of France and Guinea are planning to conduct clinical trials with Avigan in mid-November, it said.

3070920,ebola,USA,1/4/2015 23:42,0," The 30th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations will kick off on Saturday, with organisers, players and fans hoping the tournament can thrive in the face of adversity. It was only in November that Equatorial Guinea took over as hosts from Morocco, whose plea to postpone the finals over fears about the spread of Ebola was rejected by the Confederation of African Football (Caf). With concerns over the short time for Equatorial Guinea to prepare, worries about potentially poor attendances at matches in remote parts of the country and doubts about the infrastructure and facilities, football itself has taken a back seat in the build-up to the 16-team, 17 January to 8 February event. BBC Sport looks at the on main issues surrounding the continent's football showpiece. It is not the first time the small, oil-rich central African state of Equatorial Guinea, with a population of just 740,000, has hosted the tournament - they did so jointly with Gabon in 2012. However, the extra burden of going it alone, and at such late notice, is weighing heavily. Matches will be hosted in four cities; Bata and Malabo - as they were three years ago - and in Mongomo and Ebebiyin. The new venues will be relatively basic because there has been insufficient time to build better facilities in those towns. The stadium in Ebebiyin has a reported capacity of only 5,000. Even so, there is a real chance of it not being filled - one of the 2012 Nations Cup matches hosted by the country was attended by a tiny crowd of 200 people. It is that kind of statistic which has moved the country's president Teodoro Obiang Nguema to personally pay for 40,000 tickets for fans to attend matches. 'We have to buy tickets to fill stadiums,' said Nguema. 'Let those who have the means help the poor.' Additionally, the hotel capacity in the new host cities is minimal, making it a struggle for both media and fans to find accommodation and follow the tournament. On the pitch, little is expected of the team, who were eliminated from the qualifiers when they were penalised for fielding an ineligible player - Cameroon-born Thierry Fidieu Tazemeta - in a match against Mauritania, only to be reinstated when they stepped in as hosts. It would be the biggest shock in the history of the tournament if the 'National Thunder' became the 12th hosts to lift the trophy. Their chances of making any impact have not been helped by the fact their new coach, Argentine Esteban Becker, was appointed 11 days before the opening game of the finals. The deadly virus, which broke out in West Africa in March 2014 and has claimed the lives of 8,386 people in six countries according to World Health Organisation figures up to 12 January, has cast a dark shadow over the tournament. However, there are no reported cases in Equatorial Guinea and the country's government has taken measures to prevent Ebola from reaching their soil, including hiring the expertise of a team of Cuban doctors. All players and visitors entering Equatorial Guinea will be tested for Ebola. Julia Nchama Abeso Avomo, the administrative attache at the country's embassy in London, said everyone entering Equatorial Guinea will go through a short medical check upon arrival as a precautionary measure. Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are the countries worst affected by Ebola. Guinea are the only qualifiers for the finals - and their achievement is remarkable given the circumstances. The team were unable to play any matchers at home and also suffered because of the stigma of the disease. Borussia Monchengladbach winger Ibrahima Traore says the players were tested for Ebola in the dressing room, just before a vital match against Togo. 'We felt disrespected in other countries; to us it was like some people were seeing us Guineans not as human beings but as a disease,' Traore told BBC Sport. 'Now we have to forget all that and we have to perform well in Equatorial Guinea. It's something really important for our country and all the people who are suffering due to this disease. 'We want to show everyone a great image of Guinea. 'We got a $30,000 (£19,700) bonus for qualifying and I gave that money directly to charities fighting the disease. At the Africa Cup of Nations we want to fight for the people who are struggling due to Ebola.' ",NA,en,0,,,,,,,

The federal government points to vaccine manufacturing issues as the source of the slow-down in its campaign. During a Senate hearing Wednesday, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said health officials hope the program will be 'back on track of the number of vaccination doses per week that we had originally anticipated' by early November. However, 'Some experts are concerned that the wave of infections in the United States might be peaking and that the bulk of the vaccine will not become available until the disease has taken its biggest toll,' the newspaper writes. The article includes details on the waning public confidence that the government can effectively respond to the pandemic, which slipped from 73 to 69 percent since August, according to a Washington Post-ABC poll released Thursday (Stein/Laris, 10/23). The Associated Press/Charlotte Observer reports: 'Grappling with low supplies of swine flu vaccines, [Mexican] President Felipe Calderon persuaded drug makers this week to sell him 30 million doses, while 1,000 Mexicans lined up for an experimental vaccine they hope can speed up supplies.' Also this week, drug maker Sanofi-Aventis announced plans to open a plant in Mexico that 'will produce 25 million flu vaccine doses a year starting in 2012.' 'A new wave of swine flu began to flare up in Mexico last month, and officials say it will continue into early 2010,' the news service writes.

Though more studies are needed to fully understand the connection between hand-washing and the drop in cases of diarrhea, Lenis said of the data, 'this certainly raises our attention.' 'Diarrheal diseases are the biggest killer of children under age 5 worldwide ; in Bolivia, 30,000 children die each year from such illnesses,' TIME writes.
